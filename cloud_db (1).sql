I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> As a steward of the WordPress community, one of the big overarching questions that I grapple with is how to make sure people who have just found out about us know how to get around. Obviously, there&#8217;s the contributor path, which is important to me because I am especially concerned with the longevity of our little open source community, but there&#8217;s also a path for folks who are learning how to use the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And so, joining me today to talk through a project called Learning Pathways is Wes Theron. Wes, welcome to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:11] <strong>Wes:</strong> Good day. Thank you very much for having me. It&#8217;s a pleasure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Before we get into this project that we&#8217;re talking about, do you want to just tell me a little bit about who you are and what you do with the WordPress project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:22] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah. So, as you know, my name is Wes Theron. I&#8217;m based in New Zealand, and I&#8217;m an instructional designer. And, I am part of the Training Team. So, most of my life revolves around creating learning content for learn.WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:38] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Oh, that&#8217;s quite a life. Teaching people how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:42] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah, I teach WordPress. We run online workshops. I create video tutorials, courses, and now, of course, this great project we&#8217;re working on, Learning Pathways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:52] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. So, I&#8217;ve talked about Learning Pathways a few times here on the podcast, but for folks who have not heard me talk about it or who just need a more in-depth understanding, why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about this project as it stands today?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:06] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah, so when Learn started out, I think the main goal was to just get learning content on the site. But, in May of last year, we shared an individual learning survey with folks, and we were hoping to basically find out what are the needs of the learners? What are learners after? And from that individual learner survey, we actually learned a few things. We learned that tutorials, courses, and online workshops were the most used content types. We also saw that web-based learning is the most popular learning method. And then there was a clear need for a structured way of consuming learning material. And that&#8217;s basically where the Learning Pathways project was born; to create Learning Pathways that basically target various types of learners, but also various skill levels. So July of last year, we started with outlines, creating outlines for these learner pathways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:10] <strong>Wes:</strong> And then, in October of last year, we actually started creating content. So, the first learner pathways we started working on was the User Learning Pathway and the Developer Learning Pathway. And what that entails is of course, creating a Learning Pathway for beginner users, intermediate users, and then advanced users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s how we kind of broke it up. And last week, the Beginner Developer Pathway was actually published, so that&#8217;s very exciting. And a few weeks before that, the Beginner WordPress User Pathway. And yeah, of course, we&#8217;ve got many other pathways in the pipeline that we want to work on. For example, a Designer Learning Pathway and even a Contributor Learning Pathway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:57] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, when we&#8217;re talking about pathways, what we mean is, like, we are figuring out what you probably need to know when you first arrive and then helping you to identify what you build on based on what your goals might be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Like, obviously, the beginner user, the goal is basically just like, learn how to get WordPress doing stuff at all. Like that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s an easy goal to understand. But when you all were doing the work to figure out what needed to be in the pathway for a beginner developer, and as you&#8217;re looking towards doing the work around intermediate and advanced topics, like how are you all able to determine what most likely you need in those various steps in the learning process?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:42] <strong>Wes:</strong> So, of course, a lot of research went into that. When we created the outlines for these Learning Pathways. We shared it with the community. We asked for feedback. And yeah, a lot of research was done to make sure we cover all the all the bases. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:59] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I know that there were a couple of different proposals about how to, like do skills assessments, maybe? There was something where like we were talking with companies that employ WordPress folks in the ecosystem, and then we were talking to WordPressers who were currently trying to make sure that their skills were advanced enough to get those jobs. And we were trying to figure out like the distance between those and where we actually have some concerns around like the language choices that they need, like basic developer language choices and jargon that goes in there and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So this, if I recall correctly, the research for this has been going on for like maybe two or three years, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:42] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah, definitely. And we&#8217;ve reached out to many stakeholders within the WordPress community. And as you say, even agencies, and businesses, you know, trying to find out what do they want people to know when they employ them. And yeah, then of course, speaking to the community, speaking, speaking to folks at WordCamps reaching out to folks an online workshops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] <strong>Wes:</strong> So, yeah, it&#8217;s definitely been an ongoing process and also seeing what resources are lacking and what needs to be there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, so, the very first, the very first iteration of any training that the WordPress project was offering on, I think it was on learn.WordPress.org, but I don&#8217;t actually know for sure, was a troubleshooting workshop, because when you are trying to figure out WordPress for the first time, when you are trying to figure out any software for the first time, being able to figure out what went wrong is a really important part of that. And so that was like the only workshop that existed over there for quite some time. And so it&#8217;s really nice to see how we have really, not only created a bunch of resources in general, if you all have not looked at learn.WordPress.org lately, it has, like, workshop outlines that you can use to do a training by yourself at your meetup group or at a school or whatever it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But then also, I want to say it was maybe two, three years ago, that you all, as a team, the Training Team, started doing these online workshops. And so, when you created the Learning Pathways, considering like how much time and research has gone into this project overall, did you all have learnings that came from those workshops that you had already done? Is this like a collection of workshops or is this something where you can do it at home and learn by yourself and then go someplace else and learn more about WordPress? Like how does that function in what we have already?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:45] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah, so maybe I should first, maybe let&#8217;s define a learning pathway. So I, I thought about this, but a learning pathway, I would say, is a route taken by learner through a range of modules, lessons, and even courses to build knowledge progressively. So it&#8217;s similar to a course, but of course usually covers like a specific topic or subject where learning pathways usually have a larger goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:11] <strong>Wes:</strong> So I wouldn&#8217;t say that the online workshops form part of the Learning Pathways project. And maybe I can also clarify that the teacher notes or the lesson plans that you refer to is something that&#8217;s also changing going forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Oh, good. Because I wrote some of those, and I am not an instructional designer. And so, ha!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:30] <strong>Wes:</strong> We&#8217;ve actually decided to move away from having two different content types. So, we had tutorials. You know, video tutorials, and we had lesson plans, and as you said, the lesson plans were notes that somebody could use to run an online workshop or to go to a WordCamp or at their local meetup and use that to teach something. But moving forward for Learning Pathways, we are actually just going to have one content type, namely lessons. And then lessons from part of creating a course or lessons from part of creating modules and then Learning Pathways. The other exciting thing, and something we haven&#8217;t mentioned, is that at the end of this month, when we launched the Learning Pathways or the first few Learning Pathways, it actually coincides with a website redesign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:18] <strong>Wes:</strong> So, yeah, beyond the lookout, hopefully, learn.WordPress.org is going to have a brand new face at the end, from the end of July or, yeah, or August. So, yeah, that&#8217;s very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Excellent. Excellent. So, you said that these Learning Pathways are part of a larger goal. Is that a goal for your learners or a goal for WordPress? A goal for the team?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:40] <strong>Wes:</strong> I would say all of the above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:42] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Goals for everybody. We&#8217;re like the Oprah of goals. Don&#8217;t come get me, Oprah. That&#8217;s all I got to say about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:48] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah, I think for us as a team, at the end of the day, we want folks to be able to use the content and find the content and utilize all the learning material on learn.WordPress.org. And then, of course, at the end of the day, for learners, we want folks to be able to succeed in whatever they are trying to do. Is it to build their own website? Is it to maybe find a job as a developer? And. Yeah, I mean, the list can go on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. So, on the subject of wanting to help people succeed, I think that as far as I hear from the majority of contributors that I have worked with over the years, like helping other people figure out how to do this and making sure that they can succeed is always something that is top of mind for contributors to open source probably in general, but definitely to WordPress. Like, we really care about helping other people figure out how to have the same sort of benefits that we&#8217;ve had in the project and with the software. So if you have somebody who is familiar with all the bits and pieces of WordPress and really, really want to like show up and help teach some things. Is it the case that they can take part in like running a Learning Pathway? Is it something where we mostly need people to help us build some content? Like if we&#8217;ve got people who are just desperate to help other people succeed in WordPress, what kinds of things can they show up and help do on this project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:22] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yes, please come to the Training Team. There are many ways to get involved. If you just want to review content, you can do that. But yeah, we do have a need for content creators, folks, you know, creating a video lesson or putting their hand up and saying, I will actually create an entire module or an entire learning, a Learning Pathway. We do have some awesome contributors that&#8217;s part of the Training Team that are already doing that. Some people are writing scripts. Some folks are actually, you know, creating everything from the beginning to the end. So they are writing the script, they recording the video, publishing the video, et cetera. And then we&#8217;ve, of course, have people reviewing content. We&#8217;ve got folks running online workshops. If maybe creating video content is not their, is not their forte, they can can run online workshops. So yeah, many ways getting involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:16] <strong>Wes:</strong> But Josepha, I wanted to point something else out that I haven&#8217;t done. I think there was a real need for Learning Pathways because, at the moment, if somebody new to WordPress or new to developing with WordPress wants to find learning content. You know, where do they go? What&#8217;s the main platform to go to? I think most people probably go to YouTube, right?&nbsp;But a lot of the content there are, are scattered and fragmented. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a lot of learning material or learning about WordPress is all over the place. It&#8217;s not in one place. And as I said, a place where you can actually learn from A to Z, learn progressively learning in a structured way. Yes, we know there are courses available that you can pay for, but the awesome thing about this project is that we are providing these Learning Pathways, these learning resources, for free for folks to be able to work through at their own time. I know that&#8217;s something else you asked earlier on. So yes, this is a course in quotation marks; this is a Learning Pathway that somebody can start whenever it suits them, you know, in the comfort of their own home, and they can work through the Learning Pathway from the beginning to the end. Or, if they feel I actually know everything taught in module one and two, I&#8217;m going to start at module three, they can do that. They basically come in at their skill level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:43] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes. I think it&#8217;s really important to try to meet people where they are. And I know that it&#8217;s difficult because, like, we don&#8217;t take a lot of data from our users. You don&#8217;t have to give us basically anything in order to use WordPress. And by basically, I mean you literally don&#8217;t have to give us anything to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And so we always have some difficulty in figuring out what is it that our users need the most in order to succeed the quickest. And so I agree that there was a real need for this not only because, like, there&#8217;s plenty of content for getting from, like, some knowledge to a good amount of knowledge. There&#8217;s almost no content around, like, I didn&#8217;t know CMSs existed until yesterday, and now I need to quickly learn how to do it because it&#8217;s become a thing I need to do in my job. There&#8217;s some really clear, like use cases for being able to onboard quickly and progressively.<br><br>And I understand that, like, having a clear, structured way to learn doesn&#8217;t always fit with the idea of meeting people where they are. But I do really think that, that like what you were saying, it can be as structured as you need it to be. But also, if you get into it and you think to yourself, you know, I know this information already. I can move on to the next module. I can move on to the module after that. Similar to the way we do that at WordCamps also. If you get into a session and you thought it was going to be useful for you, and you discover that it&#8217;s not once you&#8217;re there, you don&#8217;t have to stay. You can go to a different room where they&#8217;re teaching about SEO if it turns out that you don&#8217;t need to learn about JavaScript today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And I think that that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s kind of the value that this is hoping to bring, like, because it is a little bit built one on top of the other when you discover that you have already learned something, you can easily try out the next step and know that it&#8217;s probably a good next step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:38] <strong>Wes:</strong> Exactly. And if you maybe want to teach this to other folks. The plan is to, you know, we had lesson plans. We have a lot of lesson plans on Learn. But the plan is also to, instead of having, as I said, two different content types, is to have lessons but then add a tab where you can click on teacher notes and actually teach something as well if that is your goal. But yes, our lessons and modules also include quizzes and, hopefully, some practical activities. We&#8217;ve incorporated WordPress Playground where, where folks can actually, you know, test out what they&#8217;ve learned or test their knowledge. So yeah, I agree with you that you can basically join the Learning Pathway wherever you feel the most comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So we&#8217;ve been kind of in the weeds of the project itself, the program itself, and if you want to like do stuff with that and in that. Let&#8217;s switch gears a little bit and talk about just what people who are wanting to join those pathways would need to know. Do you have any advice for somebody who is just today learning about these Learning Pathways and they think to themselves, I definitely want to sign up for one of those. Like, for one, how do they get started? And for two, your like top two or three bits of advice for as they get started? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:05] <strong>Wes:</strong> So you can make your way to learn.WordPress.org, and you can basically open the, the pathway, and you can start wherever, wherever you want to. We have made it possible to actually view these pathways or our content without logging in with your dot org profile. The other thing I also wanted to mention is that our content is actually hosted on YouTube now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the great thing is we have these pathways within YouTube as well. So, folks can go to the, YouTube channel and see our content. And, of course, that basically reaches a very wide audience. And hopefully some of those videos will also bring people to the dot org site so that they can access the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:57] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I think it&#8217;s great that you don&#8217;t have to sign up for a profile. If you are a brand new WordPresser and ran into this in your dashboard and are listening to this podcast now. So dot org profiles are a place where you can kind of log your activity in the WordPress community and the WordPress project. You do not have to have one in order to use WordPress. You don&#8217;t have to have one in order to look at these courses or to learn from them. But I always think that it&#8217;s kind of nice to get your profile set up so that people kind of know who you are and what you&#8217;re doing. And then also your activity shows up. Like, you can see that you enrolled in the course and you get to know for yourself that you made some progress. I know that when you&#8217;re getting started, it&#8217;s hard to, like, see your progress because you don&#8217;t know how far you have to go. And so, like progress when you&#8217;re starting out is really difficult to feel is real. And so I like it just so that you have a few reminders to yourself, like, look how far I&#8217;ve come as you&#8217;re trying to figure out how far you still have to go. And so I like that a lot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:58] <strong>Wes:</strong> You won&#8217;t be able to access all the content on Learn without your dot org profile. But one of the things we&#8217;ve made possible is to access these Learning Pathways, the new ones being launched without, you know, removing those blockers. So, of course, when you work through a Learning Pathway, you will be able to track your progress, and you will be able to see which lessons you have completed. So yeah, one of the pieces of advice I would give to somebody starting with the Learning Pathways actually to first go through the modules. And go through the lessons to see which things you know and feel comfortable with so that you don&#8217;t waste time maybe going through the first module and say, oh, I know this, and you&#8217;ve wasted time. Rather do a bit of research, a bit of reading, and then find the right place for you to start the journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:45] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That&#8217;s excellent. I also, just as a learner, I try to always learn some stuff. And also, as you get older, it&#8217;s harder and harder to learn things partially because like you&#8217;re in a set path, but also, and here&#8217;s my advice to new learners: you worry about looking foolish. Like you, you worry, you&#8217;re showing up, and you don&#8217;t know anything about anybody else in the classroom. And so there&#8217;s this feeling of like, what if I&#8217;m the only person who does not know how to make this work? What if I&#8217;m the only person who can&#8217;t figure out what Wes meant by &#8220;Playground&#8221; or whatever it is? There&#8217;s this real feeling of looking silly when you&#8217;re doing something like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:25] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I can&#8217;t control what anybody else says or does to anyone else, unfortunately. But what I can say is that I think that there&#8217;s never a bad time to start something you wish you had done, right? Like, the best time to have learned how to use your CMS, your website, make your website work was probably a year ago or something, but the second best time is today. And so, like, why not go ahead and get started and be part of that small group of adults that are learning new things every single day? I think that&#8217;s great. And so that&#8217;s my tip is to just embrace looking silly sometimes because you&#8217;re making some choices about your future, and that&#8217;s always a good choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:04] <strong>Wes:</strong> And I would also say test your knowledge. So you&#8217;ve mentioned WordPress Playground. And as I said, we&#8217;ve incorporated into the Learning Pathways, but sometimes you watch a video, or you read something, and you feel like, oh yeah, I know this, but you know, the proof is in the pudding. So go and test it out. Use a test website or use WordPress Playground and test yourself to see if you can actually implement this or do something. So yeah, that&#8217;s definitely one of the other tips I want to highlight; you know, they also say you, you learn by doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:38] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. And also, like if you have gotten to a point you&#8217;ve done the learning, you&#8217;ve done some practicing, you think you&#8217;ve got it and want to like try to figure out what other things can be done with it. I recommend this is how I did a lot of my early WordPress learning to organize an event with your local meetup.<br><br>Like, I did not know enough about WordPress when I started organizing WordPress meetups. I literally knew nothing. And I basically brought people in and was like, hey, we need people to teach us about this, us being half me. Come in and teach us. And, and that can be a really good thing, partially because, like, you get to know your local folks and see what&#8217;s going on and get a sense for, like, what is out there, especially if you&#8217;re learning this in order to run a business or to accomplish something for your job that you already have, like knowing what&#8217;s out there is super helpful. But then I find that once you embrace the fact that sometimes you will look silly, and that&#8217;s the only way that we can know we&#8217;re learning something. Like once you&#8217;ve embraced it, having some people who are willing to look a little silly with you is kind of, kind of fun, kind of nice. Also, like we&#8217;re all going to look at this problem that we definitely don&#8217;t understand and hopefully look like, at the end, we know what we&#8217;re doing, but between looking at it the first time and at the end of this meetup, we&#8217;re all going to look a little bit silly, ask silly questions. And I think that that&#8217;s a really helpful thing, too. But yeah, knowing some basic information is a great place to start before you do that, especially if you get anxious about looking silly. And I think these pathways are going to really help to get folks a little bit of a leg up on those big questions that they have as you&#8217;re starting to learn how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So we talked about, like, tips and tricks for learners in general. But if you had something that you wanted to share with us that, like, you&#8217;re really excited about for either the Training Team or for the Learning Pathways in general, I think the Learning Pathways are slated to be shipped by, like, end of September or something. So, like, a lot of them are coming quite quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:38] <strong>Wes:</strong> So I am most excited about the website redesign and the new look and feel of the website. And also, you know, one of the goals for us as a Training Team is for learn.WordPress.org to be one of the places people come to and learn about WordPress. And I feel these Learning Pathways and the new website redesign and all the hard work that&#8217;s gone into this project is hopefully going to, make that happen. As I said, our content is also available on YouTube. So we&#8217;ve really tried to make it easy for folks to find our content and also now to digest our content in a progressive and in a structured way. Because, you know, learning is hard. And hopefully, these Learning Pathways have made it easier for folks to, as you said, to build on your knowledge. You know, a lot of times, there&#8217;s knowledge gaps. And I think that&#8217;s what makes learning so hard. And hopefully with these pathways, you can build that knowledge one step at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:44] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. And as is the way with open source, like we can only make these pieces of content better if you all show up and help us like try it out, learn some stuff, and tell us what was confusing. Tell us what was too big a step. Cause yeah, you&#8217;re right. There are some knowledge gaps and when you&#8217;re on the other side of knowing something, it is so hard to tell how big a step is, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:11] <strong>Wes:</strong> Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And so we need y&#8217;all to come in here and tell us very plainly as a new learner like that was eventually what I needed, but this part here was especially confusing. This part over here was too like too many little steps like we just we&#8217;re trying to make sure that it works for you WordPressers, future WordPressers of the world. And so yeah, come build some learning with us over here on the Training Team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:35] <strong>Wes:</strong> And yes, please, we want feedback because, as you say, as we iterate, we want to improve. So there will be a place where you can provide feedback, and at the end of the pathway where there will also be a satisfaction survey for folks to to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:50] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Great. Well, folks, we&#8217;re gonna have a bunch of links in the show notes. There&#8217;s so much stuff out here to learn with and about WordPress. Wes, thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:01] <strong>Wes:</strong> Thank you for having me. And I will see you all on Learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:05] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings us now to our small list of big things. Although I have to say we have a bunch of links that we&#8217;re going to share in the show notes. If you&#8217;re listening to this in a place where there are not show notes, you can head over to WordPress.org/news. That&#8217;s where we keep all of those. If you are lucky, we also will help you find it on Twitter/X, but I think that it&#8217;s hard to find things over there these days. So WordPress.org/news is your best bet. Now, it is time for the small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, first up on my list is that WordPress 6.5.5 is now available. It&#8217;s got a few fixes in it, some maintenance things and some security fixes as well. I recommend that you update your sites immediately. You can download it from WordPress.org/download, or you can just visit your WordPress dashboard. If you&#8217;re on a managed host, they may have already done this for you, too. But auto-updates, manual updates, CLI updates. However, you want to get it done, get it done. But it is recommended to do this as soon as possible. 6.5.5.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The second thing on my list is that the WordPress Contributor Mentorship program has a call for interest out. This is a program that we launched about a year ago as well. And we had such a good bit of success at the end of the first round in February that there was significant interest in doing another cohort. So, that program connects seasoned WordPress contribution experts with folks who are new to contributing and offer a fantastic opportunity for mentees to gain hands-on experience contributing to WordPress while their mentors share their expertise and improve their leadership skills. So, most of the time, what you are going to be contributing to is probably a release of WordPress, but there are also a lot of opportunities to contribute to things like the Training Team that we&#8217;ve been talking about today and other teams as well. Not everything is focused all around our release cycle. We have things happening in the WordPress project literally all the time. It is a project that never sleeps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Speaking of projects that never sleep, our next official release, our second release of the year, is coming out. WordPress 6.6 is coming out just about a week from now. It is the second major release of 2024 and has a lot of things in it that you will want to check out. If you have not yet seen the hallway hangout where we take a look at what was happening in the release, what we intended to get into the release, take a look at it. And if you haven&#8217;t tested it yet, if you are one of our plugin developers, if you are building something on top of WordPress core, now is the time to check that out and test it against your products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing is that it&#8217;s a new month, my friends. Here we are in July, and we have a ton of things happening in the project. That&#8217;s the theme of my small list of big things: the project that never sleeps. But we have a lot of team meetings that are happening. If you haven&#8217;t attended one in a while or even if you have never attended one of these meetings and you were trying to figure out when to start, now is as good a time as any. You can join your fellow community members and contribute to the WordPress project. And there are ways that you can do that from home and from your computer and for some parts of the project, like from your phone, if you are taking photos out and about and submitting those. So check out make.WordPress.org/meetings. It&#8217;ll give you a sense for everything that&#8217;s happening. Do not get overwhelmed by that calendar. You can just choose which team you think is most interesting to you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:45] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Your small list of never-sleeping things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news.

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> My friends, another WordCamp Europe is in the books. We had the second-highest number of tickets sold in the history of our event series, with the first being WordCamp Europe in Berlin. But even with that number of tickets sold, that number of people gathering together to talk about WordPress and related things, there were still a lot of people who didn&#8217;t get to join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> For some, that came with experiencing FOMO, but some of you embraced the JOMO of it all. Either way, at this point, there are a good collection of wrap-ups and round-ups going around, so I&#8217;m here to tell you a bit about what was buzzing in the hallway track.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, everyone was so excited to see old friends and make new ones. Everywhere I turned, I saw WordPressers in clusters catching up, most included new to the crew faces. So we know that we were using the Pac-Man rule that we love so much. But even while they were catching up on the last two, three, four years, they were also talking to each other about how to get more folks to things like this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we all generally agree that your first time meeting other WordPressers can be a truly pivotal moment in your WordPress journey, it was a delight to hear so much brainstorming focused on that. From mentorship to community introduction and the future of our events, the question of how to keep our ecosystem healthy and thriving was a big topic. Does any one of us have all the answers to this? No, but fortunately, we&#8217;ve got a global set of thinkers working on this global question. So, together, I&#8217;m sure we can come up with some good guesses to try out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Secondly, I saw a ton of talks and discussions about career development, not only about how to learn more but also how to be a champion for open source in your company, how to advocate for contribution as a best business practice. And what other communities can teach us about how they commit to their user&#8217;s continuing education, for lack of a friendlier term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And boy, do I love a good conversation about how to make working in open source easier, make it more meaningful, and more impactful. I&#8217;m in favor of anything that helps to dignify our profession. The front-facing, easy-to-use experience of WordPress, in particular, has been misunderstood to mean that we are a simple piece of software for simple tasks. And that is the way with our mission really. If we succeed at democratizing publishing or learning or commerce for that matter, we are taking the arcane and making it mundane. But simple to use doesn&#8217;t mean simple to create. And I want all of our future employers and clients to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:24] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing that I saw lighting up the hallway track was the idea of bringing life and excitement back to the web. WordPress has been fighting against closed systems for a long time, but as Matt alluded to in his keynote, merely having an open web is still not quite as fun as having an active and dynamic one. And we saw that both in general desire to bring fun back to being online, but also in the fresh variety of demos and workshops that we saw in the fun that was brought to the event. There were new and shocking implementations of Playground, I must say. Which, as far as I can tell, will basically be able to run everything one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But at WordCamp Europe, it ran; it powered our second massive hybrid translation event, where we translated something like 50,000 strings. We also had an amazing speed-building duel with an accepted future challenge between Jessica Lyschik and Matt Mullenweg. And not for nothing; the way we designed; the way the event area was put together included ways to stop and just have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a little grassy area with yard games and smaller pods of chairs for those quick hallway catch-ups that you just don&#8217;t get anywhere else. And for me, it was simply lovely to see everyone embracing the fun that was there, but also hearing about how much they wanted to help the web embrace the fun that could be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:48] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:55] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Thanks for listening to my hallway track recap. Hopefully, it caused JOMO, not FOMO. And now, let&#8217;s turn our attention to the small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> First thing on my list is WordPress 6.6 update. So we are reaching the release candidate phase tomorrow. WordPress 6.6 RC1 will be released, so download and join the community helping us to get this release out the door. It is scheduled for July 16th. If you have plugins or themes or any sort of business that uses WordPress, now is the time to get in and test it on a test site. I don&#8217;t recommend putting it in production at any point, but come and test it. Help us break it so that we can make sure that it doesn&#8217;t break for other people, for the, you know, 43% of the web that uses it when we get it out the door on the 16th.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on the list is that we have a WordPress Project Contributor Handbook V2 out there. It aims to be the quintessential resource for everyone in our community. And it will provide a bird&#8217;s eye view of where to find key information and different aspects of our community. How it all kind of connects together. And, just like a release, we really need some feedback from you. There is the repo on GitHub where you can go and kind of make inline comments, join the discussion about it. It can be a go-to resource if we look at it together and make sure that it has as much information as clearly stated as you wished you had when you were learning your way around WordPress for the first time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing on the list is actually another handbook. So, the Sustainability Team has put together a handbook specifically for events. It&#8217;s their first version, and over the past few months, members of that team have been sharing their ideas and experiences on how WordPress community events can be held more sustainably. All this input created a first draft, which eventually became this first version. And so we&#8217;ll put a link in the show notes, wander over there, take a look at it, see what some best practices for sustainable events are in the WordPress ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:02] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing on my list is about WordCamp US. I realize this is a podcast about WordCamp Europe right now. And so it&#8217;s odd to think that I&#8217;m moving right along into WordCamp US. However, there is a deadline coming up. July 1st is the last day to sign up to be a volunteer at this event. It&#8217;s taking place this year in Portland, Oregon, on the west side of the US. And it should be a really fun time. It&#8217;s middle of September. Come on out there. Learn about WordPress. Learn about contribution. Maybe get some voodoo donuts. You know, the important things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser. Or, if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at WPBriefing@WordPress.org. I am your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:06] (Music outro)&nbsp;</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"17409\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"WordPress 6.6 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/06/wordpress-6-6-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Jun 2024 16:37:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:7:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.6\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=17392\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:342:\"WordPress 6.6 Beta 3 is here!

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> A pivotal moment in my WordPress journey was when someone invited me to a WordCamp. I was sort of aware of WordPress, but certainly not aware of the community or the ways of open source. And when I look back, there were a few things I wish I had known going in. I am, of course, an unapologetic extrovert and therefore unstoppable at events, but if you are headed to your first WordCamp and are feeling a little nervous or confused, then pop in some earbuds because the next 10 minutes are for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We&#8217;re going to first take a look at some basic tactical things about WordCamps, and then I&#8217;m going to tell you a few, like, human things about being a human going to events. If you&#8217;re a dog going to these events, I think that your prep is different, but also that is not my area of expertise. So the first thing, some tactical stuff about going to WordCamps. All of this happens before you even get in the front door. And so this is stuff that you can do in the comfort of your own home, on your own time, using your own computer. If you&#8217;ve got questions, you&#8217;ve got a search engine nearby to take some quick searches. Make sure you know what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first things first, the shape of a WordCamp. All WordCamps have at least one day of talks, one social event, and sponsors to connect to. Some also have extra events that you need to sign up for, like Contributor Days, workshops, things like that. But we&#8217;ll start with the main event, right? We&#8217;re going to start with the day of talks and things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So when we&#8217;re looking at the main event of a WordCamp, what you should do is you should head to the WordCamp&#8217;s website and check out the schedule. I suggest that you plan for two, maybe three things that you might want to learn and look around at the schedule to see if there are any presenters or presentations that look like they fit those things that you think you might want to learn. Because if it&#8217;s not working for you, if it&#8217;s not teaching you something, then you don&#8217;t necessarily need to be in that one. Even if you&#8217;re not sure about a session a talk that you&#8217;re planning to go to, I recommend that you stop by, and then if you find out that it&#8217;s not for you, you can leave again.  That&#8217;s fine. But I do encourage you to go to at least one thing that feels a little bit outside of your comfort zone. Even if you feel lost right now. It at least gives you an idea of what to search for once you do get to that point. I would never have known the things to search for early on in my learning of WordPress without going to at least one or two sessions that were just way over my head. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:14] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Second thing is don&#8217;t forget to check when lunch is available. And if you have dietary restrictions, let them know ahead of time. I realize this sounds silly, and I don&#8217;t know about you, but I can&#8217;t focus when I&#8217;m hungry. But also, it&#8217;s really a great, low-stakes networking time, and I think one of the overlooked networking times as well. I mean, everyone&#8217;s gotta eat, right? And it&#8217;s easier to strike up a conversation over a meal than just out of thin air or, you know, in the middle of a presentation when you&#8217;re supposed to be listening to a talk. So yeah, check out when lunch is happening! And yeah, make a friend or two, sit down at a table, and ask somebody what they&#8217;re doing with WordPress and how long they&#8217;ve been doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing that I would recommend that you do when you&#8217;re looking at kind of the main event for a WordCamp is to schedule in time to wander around and meet the event sponsors. They are all experts in some WordPress problem or other, so probably they have a solution to a problem that you have got. But they&#8217;re also how we keep our prices super low, so even if you have no problems or you think you have no problems. Still, check them out. They&#8217;re also staffed with wonderful people that are building really cool stuff with WordPress and so you might just get some inspiration out there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Now for the side events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the side events, we&#8217;re going to kind of start close to the main event and work our way out. So you&#8217;ve got generally three types of side events if you don&#8217;t count the networking things, which, in this case, I&#8217;m not. But just know that almost every WordCamp has some networking event, either an after-party or, like, a happy hour, a social that happens before the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll get emails about those if you have signed up for updates on the website. Also, you can look on the website directly. Just check out the schedule. Always go to those. The networking is the best at a WordCamp. But the side events—we&#8217;re talking about specific types. Like I said, we&#8217;re going to start close and work our way out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, workshops. These are just what they sound like. They&#8217;re classroom-style opportunities to practice the things you&#8217;ve learned at meetup events or on learn.WordPress.org, depending on how you found your way to this WordCamp. They mostly happen during the WordCamp itself. in a separate track, and there are like stacks of workshops in that track in that series of sessions. But a lot of them do require preregistration simply so that the trainer has an idea of how many people to expect. Again, if you get in the workshop and it&#8217;s way over your head, you feel like you absolutely cannot get it done, you&#8217;re always welcome to leave and check out some other area. But, in general, the workshops that we have WordCamps are pretty solid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a little bit further removed from that are our Youth and Teen Days. So this is more of an event series that is specifically designed for teens or kids who are trying to learn more about WordPress and other related business and entrepreneurial topics. It&#8217;s kind of a catch all but also has a lot of WordPress content in it. They have age limits, of course, and require separate registration for safety and planning purposes both. And those, in general, are either half-day during the WordCamp itself or a full-day during that WordCamp. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us then to the big one, the major side event. This is a full-day side event called Contributor Day. If your WordCamp has a Contributor Day, it will happen either the day before or the day after the WordCamp itself. It is an entire day where attendees come together to learn how to contribute to the future of the WordPress open source project. Now, if you are listening to this as part of, like, you&#8217;re getting ready to go to a WordCamp, and you don&#8217;t know what I meant by open source or open source project or WordPress open source project, that&#8217;s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> You&#8217;re going to learn all about it at the Contributor Day if you go, but the TLDR is that this software that you are about to choose to build your website on is built by thousands of people across the planet who are looking for the best solutions to problems that they have in their businesses that probably you will encounter or have encountered before. There&#8217;s no new problems under the sun, and open source methodologies kind of use the collective wisdom of everybody who has ever worked with a WordPress project or site and ran into a problem that they had to solve on their own, like this open source project, this community of people just make sure that that wisdom is collected and standardized and made available for all of eternity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all you need to know. Low key. I&#8217;ve made Contributor Days sound so calming. However, that is a whole day thing. It happens before or after the WordCamp. It has separate registration so that organizers of your WordCamp can plan for how many folks need to be there to teach new and returning contributors, what to do. If I&#8217;m going to be honest, if you&#8217;re going to get overwhelmed at any WordPress event, it&#8217;s going to be one of these, but they are well worth the effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Even if you just make a single contribution and never return, which I hope is not the case for you. I hope you do return. Even if you make a single contribution and never return, there&#8217;s something really grounding about seeing how much expertise and time, and care goes into this software that is, against all odds, completely free. So that&#8217;s all the tactical stuff, or a lot of it anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It at least gives you a sense for what you&#8217;re getting yourself into for your first-ever wonderful WordPress weekend. But I promised you some human stuff too. So here is my considerably shorter list of stuff to bring as a human being going to a WordCamp. There&#8217;s an optional one. I&#8217;ll start you off with an optional one. Come with an idea of what you think you want to learn. You don&#8217;t have to come with that if you don&#8217;t want to. Some of us don&#8217;t know what we don&#8217;t know yet, and that&#8217;s fine too. But if you have a sense for what you think you need to learn, you&#8217;ll have an easier time figuring out how to spend your time while you&#8217;re here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, the non-optional things. Bring some way to exchange information. It can be QR codes, business cards, or pen and paper. It doesn&#8217;t really matter as long as it&#8217;s something that works for you to be sharing information with people that you meet. Because you never know when you&#8217;re going to meet your business soulmate, but the odds that you&#8217;re going to do it at a WordCamp are pretty dang high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing to bring is bring what you need to be comfortable. Bring your water bottle, a change of shoes if you need it, spare battery for your phone, your glasses. This day is going to be long enough without worrying about small inconveniences. So bring what you need to make yourself comfortable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And finally bring your bravery. You will not know by looking at someone whether they&#8217;ve been doing WordPress stuff for two years or two weeks. But you can know that at some point, they were in the first two days of trying to figure this all out. One of the most endearing things about this community is the zeal they bring to solving a problem. So if you get lost or stuck, just ask the person next to you. We all remember what it was like to know nothing, and we are rooting for you to succeed. And that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s your whole list. That&#8217;s everything you need to know to be the most prepared first-time attendee to a WordCamp ever. If that all sounded more overwhelming than just showing up, don&#8217;t worry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also just show up. That&#8217;s what I did. And even though I knew next to nothing, those WordCampers made me feel welcome and included and kept me coming back to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Ah, WordCamps. Gosh, I love those things. So glad that we&#8217;re all getting back together for them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] (Music interlude) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings us now, my friends, to our small list of big things. If you&#8217;re a first-time WordPresser, if you&#8217;ve never been to a WordCamp, and you don&#8217;t know what any of these things are, don&#8217;t worry; you can still go take a look at them, or you can wait until later when you&#8217;re less overwhelmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, but this is our small list of big things for middle of the year 2024. First thing on my list, the gender equality in WordPress businesses survey is still open. It aims to gain critical insight into the gender composition of leadership teams, the experiences of women and gender-diverse leaders and employees, and also take a look at the challenges and barriers to their career success. I care deeply about making sure that we have a way for folks who are traditionally and historically underrepresented in technology have a way to get into our space. Obviously, women and nonbinary folks are an area that I feel particularly called to help build those on-ramps for, but I have a great concern for that across the entire ecosystem and any intersection that we run into as we get more and more users into our space. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> If you are a woman, if you work with women, if you work in WordPress, if you work in a WordPress business, go take that survey, and let&#8217;s see what we find out about what it&#8217;s like to work in this space, as somebody that we normally don&#8217;t see. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our list is that WordCamp Asia 2025 dates and venue have been revealed. So WordCamp Asia 2023 and 2024 were both major successes, and we are excited to share that the dates and venue for next year will be February 20th, 21st, 22nd in 2025 in Manila, and you&#8217;ll be able to go over to that website, take a look at it, we&#8217;ll have a link in the show notes as always and maybe start planning your your next big Asian adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing on my list is this new contributor wizard questionnaire. So, there are more than 20 teams to contribute to in the WordPress project. They all show up at those Contributor Days that I talked about. But there are more than 20 of them. They work on different parts of the WordPress project every day. And our passionate community offers contribution opportunities for everyone. I know, we know, that finding the right team is the key to a meaningful contributor experience. So, our interactive questionnaire is here to help you determine where to start. It is sometimes difficult to know whether you can contribute to a software if you are a designer, if you are a writer, if you are in marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it turns out that you can contribute to WordPress with a bunch of skills that you otherwise would not have realized. So, we&#8217;ll have a link to the questionnaire in the show notes again. Also, it&#8217;s probably going to pop up on WordCamp sites, Contributor Day sites, anything that helps you all understand where you might find a little bit of success as a contributor is a good place for it to be. Take the questionnaire, see where you land, the WordPress sorting hat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And item number four. So we&#8217;ve made some updates, not we&#8217;ve made some updates, we have some updates from the Five for the Future program. So the Five for the Future program has a long history in the WordPress project. There are a couple of different episodes in this podcast where you can learn more about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, to bolster transparency and openness, we have an update on the current state of WordPress contributions as of the end of May 2024. In the past few months, we&#8217;ve made a lot of efforts to improve the program and contributor experience in WordPress. We&#8217;ve also done a little bit of work to kind of clean up the pledges that are in there for, people or companies or teams that have found that they couldn&#8217;t continue their contributions over time. That is fine too. But we&#8217;ll have a link to that update in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode.

Depending on how things are going, it reflects on their need to find that next client.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not leading into some episode where I am going to give you tips on looking for a job or insights on best practices. I&#8217;m really not qualified for that. I have been working for myself since the late 1980s, with a few jobs here and there during those early years of surviving. I probably know as much as many of you do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, I could mention all the resources where you might find work. Michelle Freschette generously curates job openings on her X profile every Wednesday. Marcus, one of our hosts, lists those who are looking for work over on thewp.world. Not to mention sites like Post Status and others that list jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I bring this up is that, as I do every day, several times, I visit LinkedIn and typically find a message from someone asking me if I am hiring. Now I get it on both sides. Often, this is unsolicited and can be annoying. On the other hand, there are those that just need work. Their abrupt intrusion, which you may describe as random, often sounds that way. True. But we do have to understand that in some cases it&#8217;s cultural, and in other cases, it&#8217;s just the fact that they have little experience in finding a job in what we may describe as the professional or correct way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there are a couple of things here. First, they do have to connect or at least ask to connect with you to do this, unless they have a premium account, which likely they won&#8217;t be doing. That first connection may be as abrupt as a short intro asking if you are hiring, or a bit more extended by first asking to connect and then following up with something like, &#8220;Hi Bob, how are you doing?&#8221; which may then lead into the job pitch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do I personally do? I like to connect with people, and most of them are potential listeners to the podcast. So I connect a lot unless the invite to connect includes some kind of weird pitch, be it a job, services they offer, or anything like that. When they immediately come back with the pitch, well, sometimes I ignore it, or other times I reply with a polite reason why I am not interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may think I am crazy and spending way too much time doing that. Well, let me explain a couple of things about me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the ripple effect or the &#8220;you never know&#8221; effect. Each connection, no matter how it starts, can lead to something else. Maybe you think the odds are against it, but it happens. I have experienced that myself. Maybe they do become a listener. Or read one of my posts that inspires them. Or they could tell a friend or colleague about the podcast because of where their interest lies. The thing is, you never know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, I have opened the door. I&#8217;m not sure how many of you are old enough to remember door-to-door salespeople. Those ones that you would answer the door for or quickly disappear around the corner into another room hoping they didn&#8217;t see you. But for those times you did open the door, there was the invite. The chance for them to introduce themselves and give their pitch. How that moment evolved varied. But the fact is, you did invite them in. So when you connect with someone on LinkedIn, you are doing the same thing. Sure, it&#8217;s not what you may have expected or wanted, but you opened the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m not suggesting you follow my line of reasoning or even that you have the same goals as me when it comes to a platform like LinkedIn. All I want to do is to remind you that you opened the door.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In today&#8217;s episode BobWP leads into the diverse challenge of so many people in the WordPress ecosystem looking for a job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which leads into his take on LinkedIn where so many people are asking for work and how connecting is all about opening doors.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 10:08:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"Gravatar: .Link Your Gravatar Profile With A Free Custom Domain\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"https://blog.gravatar.com/?p=1527\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/26/link-your-gravatar-profile-with-a-free-custom-domain/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5270:\"<p>Every Gravatar account comes with a free customizable profile page — the original link-in-bio and your home on the web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months ago, we rolled out the ability to <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/03/28/new-gravatar-profile-features-make-it-yours/\">customize your profile URL</a>. Based on the positive feedback and overwhelming interest, we decided to take it a step further by partnering with .link to roll out custom domains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part: act now, and your personalized .link domain is on us (as in free!) for the first year. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How it works</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All users have the ability to set a custom “slug” for their profile URLs, which means you can send people to something that looks like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>gravatar.com/yourusername</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While that’s a great start, many users, brands, and businesses like using their own domain. That means that the link you share on your profiles, email signatures, business cards, etc. will look more like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>yourusername.link</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why you should be excited:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It puts your brand or identity first</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It’s easy to remember</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Custom domains are more trustworthy and receive almost 30% higher click-through rates than generic links.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using a custom domain levels up your professionalism and credibility.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can use it to connect your presence <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/03/14/a-social-experience-with-your-domain/\">across the web</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Start by logging in to your profile on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gravatar.com/profile\">Gravatar.com</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will land on your profile dashboard. At the very top left corner of the screen, you will see an area with your current URL and a headline that says ”Your profile URL is” with <a href=\"http://gravatar.com/yourusername\">gravatar.com/yourusername</a>. Just to the right, you will see two text links. Click on the one that says “Change”.</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cleanshot-2024-06-26-at-10.25.09402x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1535\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>You should automatically see the .link domain that matches your current username, go ahead and click on the &#8216;Claim domain&#8217; link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>You will be taken to a checkout screen for your domain, but the price will be $0 for the first year of registration. Proceed with the checkout process and we’ll handle the rest. You can search for other available .link domains to use, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Then What?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve secured your custom .link domain, the magic really begins. Here&#8217;s how you can maximize the benefits and make the most out of your new digital identity:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Integrate Across Platforms:</strong> Update your profiles on social media, professional networks, and other online platforms to include your new .link domain. This ensures a consistent and professional online presence.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enhance Your Email Signature:</strong> Replace your current profile link with your new custom .link domain in your email signature. This looks more professional and makes it easier for contacts to remember and visit your profile.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Business Cards and Marketing Materials:</strong> Include your .link domain on your business cards, brochures, and other marketing materials. This small change can significantly enhance the credibility and professionalism of your brand.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Track Engagement:</strong> Use URL tracking tools to monitor the performance of your new domain. This will help you understand where your traffic is coming from and how people engage with your profile.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Join the Movement</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t miss out on this opportunity to enhance your online identity and stand out in the digital space. By hosting your Gravatar profile on a custom .link domain, you&#8217;re not just adopting a new URL; you&#8217;re embracing a new era of digital identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With more services like Bluesky offering domains as usernames, this space will continue to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional domain extensions (like .com, .me, .blog, and more) will become available for a fee in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why .link?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://nova.link/why-link/\">.link domain</a> is more than just an address on the web. It&#8217;s a declaration of connectivity, a badge of identity in the digital realm, and a key to unlocking a world where your online presence is seen and felt. By reserving your unique .link domain, you&#8217;re taking full control of your connected identity on the web while building a more memorable and trustworthy brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feel free to share your experiences and feedback with us. We&#8217;re excited to see how you&#8217;ll leverage your new .link domain to elevate your digital footprint. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://gravatar.com/profiles\">Claim your free .link domain now!</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 05:15:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Ronnie Burt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Gravatar: Level Up Your Conference Game: Effective Networking Tactics\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"https://blog.gravatar.com/?p=1518\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/16/how-to-network-at-a-conference/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15357:\"<p>Walking into a networking event can be one of the most daunting experiences for new networkers. Beforehand, you often ask yourself a hundred and one questions about what to say, how to say it, and how to approach people. But don’t worry—we can help. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Networking is extremely important in the professional world. It allows for knowledge sharing, collaboration, and forming partnerships that are hard to find elsewhere. In this article, we&#8217;ll share advice and strategies to boost your confidence, establish meaningful connections, and make the most out of networking events. Whether you are an experienced professional or a first-time attendee, let’s see how you can maximize your impact at conferences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exploring top tips for networking at a conference</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Have a clear agenda</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you define your goals upfront. These might include investigating new trends, connecting with specific individuals, or promoting your product/service. Setting these goals lets you focus your efforts and measure your success. Ask yourself: <em>What do you want from this networking event?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Research attendees and participants in advance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before attending a professional conference, have a close look at the conference agenda and attendee list to pinpoint key speakers, industry leaders, and influencers. Researching speakers and attendees beforehand makes it easy to figure out who you should be speaking to! Research key people on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/login\">LinkedIn</a> and other relevant social media profiles. A great strategy for this is to see if they have a <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> profile, as this will contain all their social media information and other important links and give a solid overview of what they do.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"600\" height=\"441\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1.gif?w=600\" alt=\"Nigel Cameron’s Gravatar profile\" class=\"wp-image-1520\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/nigelcameron\">Nigel Cameron’s Gravatar profile</a> provides a snapshot of his engagement in technology and policy discussions, which could be important for meaningful interactions at the conference. Establish clear goals for whom to meet, which sessions to attend, and the outcomes you aim to achieve. This preparation will ensure your event time is productive and impactful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Establish connections beforehand and create a meeting schedule</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Plan ahead by contacting potential connections via email or social media. Use platforms like LinkedIn to introduce yourself and express interest in meeting. You can also use <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/\">Google Calendar</a> or conference apps to schedule face-to-face meetings. This means you won’t miss anyone you plan to talk to, nor do you have to awkwardly approach them!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Strengthen existing connections</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While forming new connections is important, don&#8217;t forget to nurture existing relationships. Reinforcing pre-existing ties can lead to deeper professional ties and opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>After an initial meeting, follow up with a personalized message referencing previous interactions, shared interests, and potential for future collaboration. You can take it a step further by scheduling a one-on-one meeting during the conference and using that time to catch up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Make time for new networking opportunities</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-structured schedule is great, but allowing room for spontaneous networking opportunities is equally important. These unplanned moments can often lead to the most valuable connections and insights.<br /><br />Be open to impromptu meetups or casual conversations in common areas like coffee shops, lounges, or hallways. If you overhear a discussion that piques your interest, please join in and contribute your thoughts politely. These organic interactions can generate genuine connections and reveal shared interests or challenges.<br /><br />Another way to embrace spontaneity is to participate in conference-specific social media hashtags. Many attendees use these hashtags to share insights, ask questions, and arrange informal gatherings to further professional relationships, which brings us to the next point.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Leverage social media to amplify your conference presence</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Identify the official platforms and social profiles used by the conference, and engage with them to maximize your visibility. Share compelling content that resonates with your audience throughout the event, including session takeaways, personal insights, and behind-the-scenes moments. Actively engage with posts from speakers, attendees, and influencers to cultivate meaningful online interactions that can translate into valuable offline connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When live-tweeting or providing real-time updates, balance digital engagement and in-person networking. Remember, while social media offers a powerful platform for extending your reach, face-to-face interactions remain essential for building lasting relationships and maximizing the impact of your conference experience. Using social media, you can amplify your presence, create meaningful connections, and leave a lasting impression on virtual and physical audiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Prepare conversation starters and ask leading questions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Engaging in meaningful conversations at conferences begins with the right conversation starters. Personalized openers are more impactful than generic ones, as they demonstrate genuine interest and help you stand out. One of the most important things you can do is to make sure you appear curious and knowledgeable by asking informed questions about current industry trends or recent publications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the event, research industry news and trends to develop conversation starters tailored to different professionals you might meet, such as developers, executives, or marketers. Consider asking leading questions that prompt thoughtful discussions and enable you to better understand the other person&#8217;s perspective and challenges. Here are some examples:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For developers</strong>: &#8220;I noticed your recent project on <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>. Can you tell me more about the technology stack you used and any challenges you faced?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For executives</strong>: &#8220;I read about your company&#8217;s recent expansion into international markets. What drove that decision, and what are your goals for the future?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For marketers</strong>: &#8220;I saw your recent article on social media strategies. How will emerging platforms impact marketing efforts in the coming year?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, ask questions that show genuine interest in the other person&#8217;s work and experiences!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Refine your elevator pitch</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Crafting an elevator pitch is a great way to make a memorable first impression at conferences. Start by determining the core message of your professional narrative. Ask yourself what sets you apart and makes you memorable. Focus on your value to potential contacts or employers, highlighting how your skills and expertise can benefit them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your pitch concise, aiming for 30 to 60 seconds to respect the listener&#8217;s time and maintain their attention. Ensure your pitch is adaptable, allowing you to tailor it to different audiences and situations for maximum impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Plan your exit strategy</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a solid exit plan is not just about escaping a failed conversation; it&#8217;s a crucial aspect of professional networking that allows you to gracefully transition between interactions and make the most of your time at a conference. A well-crafted exit strategy enables you to smoothly end conversations, both successful and unsuccessful, while maintaining positive connections and your reputation. Knowing when to politely wrap up an interaction is just as important as starting one, as overextending a conversation can be detrimental. Clear exit strategies and steps can minimize disruptions, help you adapt strategically to new possibilities, and ensure you have the opportunity to connect with a diverse range of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to do it right:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Understanding social cues</strong>: Read body language and conversational cues to gauge when to exit a conversation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Creating natural transition points</strong>: Guide conversations toward a courteous conclusion by finding natural pauses or wrapping up current topics.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Offering a tangible follow-up</strong>: Suggest specific ways to reconnect, such as exchanging emails or connecting on LinkedIn, and use tools like <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> to streamline the process.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Excusing yourself politely</strong>: Use phrases like &#8220;It&#8217;s been great chatting, but I don&#8217;t want to monopolize your time&#8221; to signal departure graciously.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Timing your departure</strong>: Find the right moment to leave, neither lingering too long nor exiting abruptly, to ensure a positive impression.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Use Gravatar as your contact-sharing app</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"373\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-8.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar profile example\" class=\"wp-image-1521\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> as your go-to contact-sharing tool can revolutionize your conference experience.

One way users can express individuality on your site is through profile pages, which gives them control over their online information and presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When designing user profiles for your websites or web apps, it&#8217;s important to create a clean and user-friendly design. Profile pages are the first point of interaction, setting the tone for the overall experience. A well-designed profile page enhances user satisfaction by providing easy navigation and interaction. It also boosts retention rates by making users feel valued and understood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s explore the important elements of a well-designed profile page, check out some examples, and see how <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> can make things easier!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Essential components of your website’s profile page design</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Profile picture or avatar</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"427\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image.jpeg?w=660\" alt=\"Upload a profile picture\" class=\"wp-image-1499\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Allowing users to upload a profile picture is the easiest and most basic way to start a profile page. A profile picture lets someone establish their identity on your website and helps users feel more connected to the platform and each other.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maintain consistency, provide guidelines for acceptable image sizes and resolutions. For example, a standard size of 400&#215;400 pixels at 72 DPI is usually sufficient. Ensure content is relevant and follows community standards. A reporting system can create a safe and respectful environment instead of approving profile pictures one by one. This method combines effective moderation with community empowerment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Name and username</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"428\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1.jpeg?w=660\" alt=\"Insert your own name\" class=\"wp-image-1500\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Deciding whether to display the user&#8217;s real name, username, or both is an important aspect of profile page design. This decision impacts <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/04/10/personal-branding-tools/\">personal branding</a> and privacy. For instance, using real names can enhance authenticity, which is beneficial for <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/16/how-to-network-at-a-conference/\">professional networking</a>. On the other hand, usernames might be better for privacy, making them suitable for social or gaming communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Implement validation rules to make sure usernames are appropriate, unique, and memorable. Consider constraints like minimum and maximum character limits, prohibition of offensive terms, and the inclusion of alphanumeric characters only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Allow usernames like LucyMcMuppet</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/274e.png\" alt=\"❎\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Prevent usernames like LucyXoXoMcMup&lt;3</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bio section</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"426\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2.jpeg?w=660\" alt=\"Bio section \" class=\"wp-image-1501\" />\n\n\n\n<p>A bio section allows users to introduce themselves, share their interests, or provide a brief professional background. This section adds a personal touch and can be a great way to build connections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maintain consistency and readability, consider implementing character limits (e.g., 150-300 characters) and providing basic formatting options like bold or italic text. This ensures bios are concise and informative without overwhelming the reader.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Interests or skills</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Including fields for users to list their interests, skills, or expertise enhances the social aspect of your platform by facilitating connections based on common interests. Implement a system that allows users to select from predefined categories or add custom tags to their profiles. This helps users express themselves and makes it easier for others to find and connect with them based on shared interests or skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Contact information</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"459\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-3.jpeg?w=660\" alt=\"Contact information button\" class=\"wp-image-1502\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Allow users to provide contact information, such as an email address or social media handles, to enable communication and networking opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, users should be able to choose whether their email is visible to everyone, only to connections, or kept private. This flexibility helps users feel secure and in control of their information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Other design elements to make your user profile pages stand out</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporating various elements can significantly enhance user experience and engagement when designing user profile pages. However, it&#8217;s important to note that these features are unnecessary for <em>every </em>profile template. Choosing to incorporate them depends on the specific kind of website you&#8217;re building and the level of interaction between users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Work information</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporating sections for users to show their professional experience, skills, and achievements adds depth to user profiles. Features like timelines, bullet points, or multimedia elements make work history engaging and easy to read.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Timelines help visualize career progression, while bullet points highlight skills and achievements succinctly. Multimedia elements, such as videos or project images, provide a richer context and make profiles more dynamic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Verified accounts and essential links</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving users the choice to show badges or indicators for verified accounts boosts credibility and trust. Verification can involve confirming emails or integrating with social media accounts. For instance, users can link their profile to their <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/?lang=en\">X/Twitter</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/learning\">LinkedIn</a> accounts, which helps <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/02/21/securing-cyber-space-role-of-digital-identity-verification/\">verify their identity</a> through these established platforms. This assures other users of their authenticity and adds an extra level of security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create a system for users to include significant links, such as personal websites, portfolios, or relevant external resources. Using icons or logos to represent various types of links or verified accounts ensures they are easily recognizable and visually appealing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Customization options</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Customization options allow users to personalize the look and feel of their profile pages, increasing their sense of ownership and satisfaction. Let users choose color schemes, layouts, or background images while ensuring these options align with your website&#8217;s overall branding and design guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Multimedia elements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporate features that let users display their work, portfolios, or media files directly on their profile pages. This is particularly valuable for creative professionals who want to display their projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that these multimedia elements are optimized for fast display and loading times to maintain a smooth user experience. Use responsive design principles to ensure that multimedia content looks good on all devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Privacy and security settings</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.nortonlifelock.com/us/en/newsroom/press-kits/2022-norton-cyber-safety-insights-report-special-release-online-creeping/\">85% of adults</a> worldwide eager to take additional steps in protecting their online privacy, it’s important to ensure that settings are in place so users can control the visibility of their contact details. Implement granular privacy settings that enable users to control the visibility of their profile information to different user groups or the public.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow best practices for data security and privacy to protect user information. This includes using secure protocols for data transmission, regularly updating your security measures, and being transparent about data use policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Examples of websites with stunning user profile page design</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for some inspiration for beautifully designed user profiles, these websites are great examples. Let’s take a look so you can gather ideas to build a standout profile page template on your own platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gravatar</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"403\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar homepage\" class=\"wp-image-1503\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> is an online profile management system widely used by platforms like <a href=\"http://wordpress.com\">WordPress.com</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, and <a href=\"https://slack.com/intl/en-gb\">Slack</a>.

It enables applications to obtain user data from a service provider, all without requiring the user to share their password with the application. This protocol acts as the middle man, granting access rights rather than exchanging sensitive login credentials. Here’s how:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>An application requests access to resources controlled by the user and hosted by a service provider.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Upon user approval, the application receives an access token from the OAuth 2.0 server.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>This token then allows the application to access the user’s data, but only within the scope that the user has approved.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"330\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-24.png?w=660\" alt=\"OAuth Protocol\" class=\"wp-image-1409\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>OAuth 2.0 greatly improves security and reduces potential vulnerabilities, as applications do not need to store, manage, or directly handle user passwords. It helps protect user privacy by ensuring that applications can only access specific, user-approved information. This selective access is important in minimizing the risk of over-sharing personal data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most visible applications of OAuth 2.0 in everyday internet use is the “Log in with…” feature found on many websites. This allows users to access multiple platforms using a single set of credentials, streamlining the login process while maintaining high security and privacy standards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"660\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-25.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of sign-in window \" class=\"wp-image-1410\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Roles in the OAuth 2 framework</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding the different roles and their interactions within the OAuth 2.0 framework is necessary for developers and IT professionals aiming to implement OAuth in their applications. Let’s take a look:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Resource owner</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The resource owner is the person or entity that has the authority to grant access to their private resources (like personal information or data) stored on a server. This person decides whether an application can access that data and what level of access it can have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you are using a service like a social media platform and a third-party application requests permission to access your profile information or post updates on your behalf, you, as the resource owner, have the authority to approve or deny such requests. This approval often comes in the form of an <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/05/04/authentication-protocols/\">authentication process</a> followed by an authorization step, where you explicitly grant permissions to the application.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Resource server</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The resource server safely stores the resource owner’s data and is responsible for validating the access tokens presented by the client, ensuring that only authorized requests are fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon receiving a request, the resource server checks the accompanying access token to verify its authenticity and relevance for the requested resources. If the token is valid, the resource server proceeds to serve the requested data, following strict security measures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the token validation, the process includes Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, scope restriction, rate limiting and monitoring, and secure token storage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Client</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The client refers to the application seeking access to the resource owner’s account. It initiates the authorization process by generating an authorization request Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which redirects the resource owner to a consent page. Here, the resource owner can approve or deny the request for access.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon receiving authorization, the client is issued access tokens by the authorization server. These tokens are critical for accessing protected resources because they prevent unauthorized access and ensure the continued trust of the resource owner.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why the client must manage them with utmost security, including storing them securely and handling token renewal processes efficiently.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Authorization server</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The authorization server checks the resource owner’s login details and gives access tokens to the client. It has two main parts: <strong>the authorization endpoint </strong>and <strong>the token endpoint</strong>. The authorization endpoint is where the resource owner says yes to the client’s request for access. The token endpoint is where the client trades a special code for an access token.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These parts help make sure that the client and the authorization server can talk safely and clearly and that access tokens are given out only after the resource owner’s details are correctly checked and approved.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Diving into OAuth 2.0 grant types</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>OAuth 2.0 offers several grant types, each designed to cater to specific authorization scenarios. Understanding these grant types, their applications, advantages, and potential drawbacks is vital for implementing secure and effective authorization mechanisms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Authorization code</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Web and mobile applications primarily utilize the authorization code grant type to obtain an access token after the resource owner grants access. This process is simple:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The application redirects the user to the authorization server, where they can log in and approve the access request.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Upon approval, an authorization code is sent back to the application, typically via a callback URL – this is called “redirection.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The application then exchanges this code for an access token at the authorization server.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This method enhances security by using “verifiers” or “secrets” that prevent the interception of the access token. The redirection mechanism, coupled with the code exchange, forms a secure foundation for granting access while mitigating risks associated with direct token exposure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Refresh token</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Refresh tokens are used to maintain long-term application access without requiring the user to authorize repeatedly. Once an access token expires, the application can use a refresh token to obtain a new one, thus ensuring continuous access.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This mechanism is particularly beneficial for applications that require prolonged access to a user’s resources. However, it introduces security considerations, such as the potential for refresh token theft, so users have to be extremely careful to protect these tokens and limit unauthorized access.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Client credentials</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The client credentials grant type is tailored for scenarios where an application needs to access its own resources rather than acting on behalf of a user. In this flow, the client authenticates itself with the authorization server using its own credentials and receives an access token in return.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This grant type simplifies the authorization process for accessing the client’s resources, making it suitable for internal applications that require no user interaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Application authentication for <strong>accessing cloud resources</strong> to perform operations like backups, data analysis, or scaling resources based on load.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Authorization for <strong>automated tasks like database cleanup or software updates</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Application <strong>access to public APIs without user data</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Authentication for applications <strong>retrieving metrics, performing health checks, or executing management commands</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, since it does not involve user authorization, it is not applicable for accessing user-specific data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Resource owner password</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The resource owner password grant type assumes a high level of trust between the user and the client, as it involves sharing sensitive login details. It works like this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>User provides username and password to the client.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The client sends these credentials to the authorization server.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Authorization server verifies credentials.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If valid, the server issues an access token (and optionally a refresh token) to the client.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The client uses the access token for authenticated requests on behalf of the user.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to its inherent security risks, such as the potential for credential theft, this grant type should be used sparingly and only in contexts where other, more secure methods are impractical.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing additional security measures, like using this grant type exclusively with confidential clients and adding extra layers of authentication, can help mitigate these risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding endpoints in the OAuth2 framework</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the OAuth2 framework, there are two key endpoints – ‘/authorize’ and ‘/oauth/token’. Using an OAuth library or framework can greatly simplify the management of these endpoints, handling much of the complexity behind the scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>/authorize endpoint</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ‘/authorize endpoint’ serves as the initial step in the authorization process, where the resource owner authenticates with the service and grants access to the application. This endpoint is crucial for obtaining an authorization code in grant types like the ‘authorization code’ and, historically, the ‘implicit’ grant type.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it’s important to note that the implicit grant type is no longer recommended by OAuth best practices and may be prohibited on some servers due to security concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a user accesses the ‘/authorize endpoint’, they are presented with a consent screen. The URL for this endpoint typically includes several key parameters:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Client ID: </strong>The public identifier for the application.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Redirect URI:</strong> The location where the authorization server sends the user after granting or denying access.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Response type:</strong> Indicates the authorization processing flow, typically set to “code” for the authorization code flow.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Scope:</strong> Specifies the level of access that the application is requesting.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>State:</strong> A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token that can be used to mitigate CSRF attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These parameters help ensure the authorization request is explicit about its intentions and secure against potential threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>/oauth/token endpoint</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ‘/oauth/token endpoint’ is where the application can make a POST request to exchange an authorization code for an access token, renew an access token using a refresh token, or obtain an access token directly through the client credentials grant. This endpoint supports various grant types, including ‘authorization code’, ‘password’, ‘client credentials’, and ‘refresh token’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When generating tokens, the authorization server must ensure they are created securely and include any optional refresh tokens. This process is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of the access tokens. To prevent CSRF and other attacks, tokens must be handled securely, necessitating the use of HTTPS for all communications with this endpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A POST request to the ‘/oauth/token endpoint’ requires specific parameters depending on the grant type being used:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Grant type: </strong>Specifies the grant type of the request.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Client ID and client secret:</strong> Credentials that authenticate the client to the server.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Code:</strong> The authorization code received from the ‘/authorize endpoint’ (for the authorization code grant type).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Redirect URI:</strong> Must match the URI used in the original authorization request.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding the authorization code flow</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The authorization code flow is designed to facilitate secure interactions between the client, the authorization server, and the resource server.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This flow is particularly important because it ensures that access tokens are not exposed in environments that are not fully secure, such as a user’s browser, thereby significantly reducing the risk of token interception.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 1: User authorization request</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The process begins when the client directs the user to the authorization server. Here, the user authenticates themselves and consents to the client’s request for access to their resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This step is initiated through a URL that the client constructs, which includes parameters like the client ID, the requested scope, the redirect URI, and a state parameter for CSRF protection. An example URL might look like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"https://authorization-server.com/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=CALLBACK_URI&scope=REQUESTED_SCOPE&state=CSRF_TOKEN\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://authorization-server.com/authorize?response_type=code&#038;client_id=CLIENT_ID&#038;redirect_uri=CALLBACK_URI&#038;scope=REQUESTED_SCOPE&#038;state=CSRF_TOKEN</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 2: Redirection and authorization code</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon successful authentication and authorization by the user, the authorization server redirects the user back to the client using the redirect URI provided in the initial request. This redirection URI includes an important element: the authorization code. It may also contain the state parameter if it was included in the initial request, ensuring that the request has not been tampered with.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Step 3: Exchanging the authorization code for an access token</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The client then takes this authorization code and makes a backend request to the authorization server’s ‘/oauth/token’ endpoint to exchange it for an access token. This step is crucial because it occurs server-to-server, far from the potential prying eyes of malicious actors in the user’s browser environment. The request includes the authorization code, the client’s ID and secret (for confidential clients), and the redirect URI to verify the request’s authenticity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The authorization code flow offers significant security advantages. By obtaining the authorization code through a user-agent redirect and exchanging it for an access token in a server-to-server call, the access token is kept away from the user’s browser history, reducing the risk of exposure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This method provides a mechanism that caters to confidential and public clients while upholding the security integrity of the OAuth 2.0 framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pairing Gravatar with your authorization server</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"403\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-26.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar homepage\" class=\"wp-image-1412\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The security of your users doesn’t stop with authentication but also extends to the way you manage their data. <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>, widely recognized for its globally unique avatars, is a profile management tool suitable for all kinds of websites, applications, and eCommerce stores.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your website is integrated with Gravatar, then you’ll be able to import profiles from anyone who signs up with you and has a Gravatar profile.

SSO allows users to log in to multiple applications or platforms using just one set of credentials, eliminating the need to remember numerous passwords. This enhances user experience and boosts security by reducing password fatigue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we’ll be taking a closer look at the best SSO solutions, catering to a wide range of needs – from internal user management within enterprises, businesses, schools, and other organizations to online, user-facing platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s begin!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SSO is a popular approach to digital identity management, allowing users to access multiple applications with just one set of credentials. This method simplifies the login process, enhances security, and reduces the need for multiple passwords.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong> Upon the initial login, SSO verifies the user&#8217;s identity and generates an authentication token to access other connected systems, eliminating repeated login prompts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This method brings many benefits, such as increased user convenience, lower IT costs for managing password recovery, and heightened security by minimizing password-related risks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s important to differentiate SSO from cloud identity and access solutions, which offer broader identity management features beyond SSO, such as password vaults, directory services, user provisioning and de-provisioning, authorization, and role-based access control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SSO is particularly useful in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Corporate settings</strong>, where employees access numerous platforms.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Educational institutions</strong>, for easy access to learning resources.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Websites and eCommerce</strong>, enhancing user experience with quicker logins.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Social media </strong>for streamlined access across platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to add SSO to your workflow, keep reading as we look into the various options available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exploring Top SSO solutions&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>OneLogin</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"247\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-16.png?w=660\" alt=\"OneLogin homepage\" class=\"wp-image-1398\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.onelogin.com/product/sso\">OneLogin</a> is a leading SSO provider designed for IT systems and organizations, including enterprises and educational institutions.

They are like online bouncers, checking IDs before letting anyone in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These protocols are the first defense against unauthorized access, ensuring that sensitive information doesn’t fall into the wrong hands. This can prevent data breaches, substantial financial losses, and reputation damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From traditional password-based methods to cutting-edge biometric verification, authentication protocols follow three main steps:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Identification</strong>, where the user claims an identity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Authentication</strong>, where they prove their identity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Authorization</strong>, where they get access to resources.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Encryption and decryption are at the heart of these protocols, maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the data being exchanged. Even if the data is intercepted, it remains unintelligible without the correct cryptographic key that unlocks its encryption.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exploring the most popular authentication protocols</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WebAuthn</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"330\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image.png?w=660\" alt=\"WebAuthn registration ceremony\" class=\"wp-image-1372\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://webauthn.io/\">WebAuthn</a>, short for Web Authentication, is a browser-based Application Programming Interface (API) that works with biometric information. This means that it uses data like fingerprints and facial recognition or physical security keys instead of traditional passwords, which can be forgotten or stolen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Use cases</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>WebAuthn is adopted by major web browsers and a growing list of online platforms, allowing them to streamline the login process with a simple fingerprint scan and an extra layer of security through two-factor authentication.

Its primary purpose is to securely establish a connection without transmitting the actual password over the network.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It operates in three phases: link establishment, authentication, and network connection. This ensures secure data exchange by periodically verifying the identity of the client using a three-way handshake method.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commonly used in ISP settings, Point-To-Point (PPP) connections, and remote server access, CHAP provides a layer of security by preventing unauthorized access.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>EAP</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"330\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-6.png?w=660\" alt=\"Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)\" class=\"wp-image-1379\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) serves as a versatile framework supporting multiple authentication methods, making it adaptable to various network requirements. It is primarily utilized in wireless networks and point-to-point connections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>EAP functions by providing a standard mechanism for authentication, offering a range of methods such as EAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security), EAP-TTLS (Tunneled Transport Layer Security), and PEAP (Protected EAP), among others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These methods cater to different security needs, showcasing EAP&#8217;s flexibility in authenticating network access.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>PAP</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"330\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-7.png?w=660\" alt=\"Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)\" class=\"wp-image-1380\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) is one of the simplest forms of network security authentication mechanisms, and it operates by exchanging plain-text passwords across the network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because this method is inherently less secure, PAP is generally used as a &#8220;last resort”, particularly in environments where other, more secure methods are not available or feasible. When other options are available, PAP is typically bypassed due to its vulnerability to eavesdropping attacks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>TACACS</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"330\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-8.png?w=660\" alt=\"Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS)\" class=\"wp-image-1381\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS) is used for verifying users on a network, particularly in environments requiring centralized control over authentication and authorization services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It creates a secure dialogue between a client and an authentication server, employing a more sophisticated authentication mechanism than simpler protocols. It also allows for granular control over user permissions and the flexibility to support various authentication methods.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its strengths, the TACACS’s complexity and the need for specialized knowledge for implementation are considered drawbacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Choosing the right authentication protocol: A use case approach</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Selecting the optimal authentication protocol is crucial for enhancing a system&#8217;s performance, its security, and a smooth integration process. The decision on which authentication protocol to use can be influenced by several factors:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>System architecture: </strong>The structural design of the system determines compatibility with different protocols.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Resources available: </strong>Time, budget, and technical expertise available can significantly narrow down choices.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Specific security requirements: </strong>Different protocols offer varying levels of security, making some more suitable for certain scenarios than others.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Use case examples:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Small business server: </strong>For small businesses with limited resources and technical expertise, a protocol like RADIUS, known for its broad vendor compatibility and ease of deployment, might be the most appropriate choice.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cloud-based web application:</strong> OAuth shines in scenarios requiring secure third-party app integrations, making it ideal for cloud-based applications that need to support social media logins or access to other online services.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enterprise-level network: </strong>An organization requiring robust security and SSO across multiple systems might find Kerberos to be the best fit, thanks to its ability to protect against password attacks and support for complex network architectures.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In certain contexts, a lesser-used protocol could be more effective. For instance, CHAP might be chosen over OAuth for its utility in point-to-point connection settings where third-party app integration isn&#8217;t a priority, but periodic authentication checks are essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, you have to use multiple protocols to meet all the security and functionality needs of a system effectively. This flexibility will make sure that as your business grows or technology advances, the authentication mechanisms can grow and evolve with it, maintaining security and performance without compromising on user experience or system integrity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pairing your authentication protocol with Gravatar for a complete digital identity management solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ll4OpUpkzXRSe1JAqrYViBLK2Xq_J0yozavb0Tvq0fRoX3k9sgk_-BrVbaXE2ytBCtmh_t8xPwOiAriyajisDqsb4fbZf042f0xH9OnyDIzv_daZ_gH-KiBnqKYFp7eS2JB7Lh5hSFvrE-DeC-UY9Rg\" alt=\"Gravatar homepage\" />\n\n\n\n<p>So far, we’ve looked at the various authentication protocols available to help you choose the right one, whether it’s for your website, web app, internal login portal for your business, or any other use case.

Instead, passkeys encompass facets like “something you are”, like biometrics, or “something you have”, such as a physical security key.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/mJ-N_j8Rr3Kta7O0S1DPWe0hisuvejqbUimVJUxf6QqdNMVvbEEaURvRXrm342DaXsuKk8ce9AZBJs05gXVDUrN5tzDUJ0-2oGcoR6tJ98YNeS1jc63lCtOmY0FQaFyK-9JYAbF-uiPGN406xgZUwGU\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Example of biometric authentication</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using passkeys for your websites and platforms gives visitors an easy way to verify their identity without typing complex passwords, replacing them with unique and often temporary credentials, enhancing security and user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tokens often come in the form of unique, time-sensitive codes that protect online spaces against unwanted entries. The most common types include facial and fingerprint recognition, complicated designed patterns, or secure PINs, which are often specially generated for this specific login attempt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many advantages to integrating passkeys:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Enhanced security: </strong>Passkeys offer a more secure authentication method compared to traditional passwords, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>User-friendly: </strong>They simplify the login process, making it quicker and more convenient for users by eliminating the need to remember and type passwords.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reduced forgetfulness issues: </strong>The temporary nature of passkeys means users don&#8217;t have to remember a static password, decreasing the chances of lockouts due to forgotten passwords.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Resistance to brute force attacks:</strong> Passkeys&#8217; unique and often temporary nature makes them much harder for attackers to guess through repeated trial and error.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Decreased dependency on password recovery: </strong>Passkeys significantly reduce the reliance on potentially insecure password recovery methods, as users no longer need to reset forgotten passwords frequently.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Passkeys are built on FIDO standards</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>​​Short for Fast Identity Online, <a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/what-is-fido/\">FIDO is a global authentication standard</a> designed to reinforce and simplify the <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/02/21/securing-cyber-space-role-of-digital-identity-verification/\">digital authentication process</a>, making it simpler for users and more secure against threats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These standards are based on public key cryptography and have played a crucial role in encouraging the adoption of passkeys by ensuring they comply with rigorous security and ease-of-use criteria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the integration of FIDO protocols, such as <a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/specs/u2f-specs-master/fido-u2f-overview.html\">U2F (Universal 2nd Factor)</a> and <a href=\"https://webauthn.io/\">WebAuthn</a>, passkeys benefit from an advanced security infrastructure. U2F adds a layer of protection by involving a physical security key in the authentication process, while WebAuthn allows for the registration and verification of users on web applications through biometric data, mobile devices, or FIDO security keys, moving away from password reliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combination of passkeys with FIDO standards has significantly improved digital authentication, making it safer and more user-friendly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding the user flow with passkeys</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Passkeys are revolutionizing the way we authenticate, making logging in smoother and more secure. Imagine the ease of entering a secure system or website without the hassle of remembering complex passwords. Here&#8217;s a simple breakdown of how a typical passkey authentication process works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Registration: </strong>First, a user chooses to create a passkey for a service. This often happens during the initial sign-up or through a settings menu for existing users. The user confirms their identity through a verification method, like an email link or a text message code.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Creating a passkey: </strong>The system prompts the user to authorize the creation of a passkey. This can be done using a device&#8217;s biometric features (like a fingerprint or facial recognition) or a PIN. The passkey is then generated and securely stored on the user&#8217;s device, as well as with the service, but in a way that the service can&#8217;t see the passkey itself.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> When returning to the service, the user is prompted to unlock their passkey, again using biometrics or a PIN. The device then communicates with the service, confirming the user’s identity without transmitting the passkey. This seamless interaction ensures that the user&#8217;s credentials are never exposed to potential theft.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/h-3BYhKjAzHzS7m2CRR052HrW-uSCLfW3eq3yuOBTOKOERTvaDgYpP6_DkkRcf4XV3a8297IjTP6_rVix8LoMDLp3yO-GJb7z4XVyjRxUoKDpGMlybjbSiOiQnWHPCrOikaHtJlKqkxHcz-cQhxr9Wk\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>How passkey authentication works</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Cross-device usage: </strong>Passkeys can also be used across different devices, thanks to cloud synchronization, making authentication even more convenient without compromising security.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This flow stands out from traditional passwords by eliminating the need for users to remember anything or enter credentials manually, reducing the risk of phishing or password theft. Besides that, because the authentication is tied to the user&#8217;s device and/or biometrics, it significantly enhances security.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exploring real-world examples of the Passkeys experience</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>iOS, Android, and desktop recognition&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On mobile platforms like <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17/\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.android.com/\">Android</a>, the experience of using passkeys is designed to be incredibly intuitive. When users attempt to log into a service that supports passkeys, the operating system prompts them to authenticate using a method they are already familiar with, such as a fingerprint, facial recognition, or a PIN.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of modern laptops, both <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows\">Windows</a>, include a fingerprint scanner in the power button, and since 2015, Windows laptops have started including facial recognition, as well. Until a few years ago, this was a function only available for mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, this is how the prompt looks on a Mac laptop when trying to access information behind a security wall, such as the <a href=\"https://passwords.google.com/\">Google Password Manager</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/GZlGyRgyu3PrBnsgE5crkCM3Kk4HU6B2_a35zOEDRaEgd85wDYjTpmqT8D-pwSJyMgelVRpb7rFIcKWJMcTHu-y-sMk9hYHzqB3HtL_WYsCP2_98CDtFAI_Uax15ZHJkkV0EeJ7aOuV4npax5rKz-pM\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Touch ID option on a Mac computer</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the device&#8217;s settings, people can specify where they want to use this type of recognition.

Let’s see why.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>They&#8217;re safer</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional systems are very vulnerable. For example, in 2021, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/18/nyregion/nyc-law-department-hack.html\">the New York City Law Department experienced a significant cyberattack</a>, where attackers accessed sensitive data, including city employees&#8217; personal information, police misconduct evidence, plaintiffs&#8217; medical records, and the identities of minors charged with crimes, through a single employee&#8217;s compromised email password.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Passkeys, on the other hand, are immune to common threats like phishing and keylogging, as they do not transmit sensitive information that can be intercepted or deceitfully obtained.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is possible because passkeys use public-private key cryptography, a method far superior to the conventional password system. Unlike passwords, which rely on a shared secret known by both the user and the service, passkeys work by creating a pair of keys: a private one that stays with the user and a public one stored on the server. So, even if a server is compromised, attackers cannot impersonate the user without access to the private key.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>They’re easier to use</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Passkeys significantly simplify the user experience. People don’t need to remember complex passwords, manage multiple credentials, and constantly reset passwords.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, they gain access with just a tap or a biometric check, making the process not only quicker but also more enjoyable.

This ease of use can significantly boost conversion rates, as users are more likely to complete sign-up processes and continue using services that offer an effortless access method.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, by adopting passkeys, companies can distinguish themselves from competitors, offering a modern and secure authentication solution that appeals to privacy and convenience-conscious consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>They can be used for single sign-on purposes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Passkeys seamlessly integrate with <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/05/09/single-sign-on-solutions/\">Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions</a>, enhancing both convenience and security. SSO allows users to access multiple services or applications with a single set of credentials, reducing the burden of remembering numerous passwords.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By incorporating passkeys into SSO frameworks, users enjoy an even smoother login experience across various platforms, with the added benefit of heightened security.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This integration not only simplifies user access but also bolsters productivity and security for businesses by minimizing the potential attack surface for cyber threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>It’s time to enter a passwordless future</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of this article, you’ll have understood what passkeys are – and more importantly, you’ll hopefully agree that it’s time for passkeys to trump passwords once and for all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>, we’re paving the way for a more open, connected, and user-centric internet – and our approach to profile management lets you build a complete digital identity management solution along with your passkeys authentication service.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With more than 20 years of serving as people’s globally recognized avatar, Gravatar allows users to create profiles that serve as universal identifiers across any website or web application that integrates with Gravatar’s API.

Until April 2023, you could only put one link in your bio, but since then, Instagram has increased that number to five.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, even with that change, the author bio is still quite restrictive and doesn’t allow you to customize your profile fully or add other elements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution to that is to put a “transition” link – one that will open a new webpage filled with all the links your heart desires, whether it’s your blog, store, portfolio, or other relevant social media pages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/?hl=bg\">Instagram</a> doesn’t come with this feature, so in order to get the multifunctional “link in bio,” you need a specialized tool for the job. In this guide, we’ll introduce you to 10 excellent tools for breaking free from Instagram&#8217;s limitations and expanding your online presence effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Gravatar&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"403\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-21.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1342\" /><em>Gravatar homepage</em>\n\n\n\n<p>Instagram is just one platform, and if you want to create a permanent space on the internet, you need to think about your online presence beyond social media.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to do that is by creating a universal profile – an online identity that travels with you no matter where you go. <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> by <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> is a free tool that can do that and much more. While not exclusively a “link in bio” tool, Gravatar still brings a lot of useful features that you can use to expand your Instagram bio section.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is what you can do with it!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Personalize your “About” section</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard to describe yourself in a captivating way with just 150 characters, but that’s all Instagram gives you. With Gravatar, however, you have the opportunity to craft an “About” section brimming with personality. When users click on the Gravatar link, they’ll be redirected to your Gravatar profile which will look more or less like this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"373\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-22.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1343\" /><em>Gravatar profile bio section</em>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a space where you can tell <em>your story</em>, sharing not just a basic bio but also details, such as your name, pronunciation, and location.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>List your verified accounts</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Linking and showing your verified accounts is important as it gives you more brand credibility, whether you&#8217;re an influencer, CEO, author, academic speaker, and so on. As a result, people who open your Gravatar profile will be more inclined to follow you on different platforms beyond Instagram, and they&#8217;ll know where to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Gravatar, you can add multiple popular platforms, including <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/x\">X/Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/\">TikTok</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/\">Twitch</a>, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"383\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-23.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1344\" /><em>Gravatar’s verified accounts list</em>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Add important links</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Confined by Instagram&#8217;s solo link policy? Gravatar can help! Accentuate your profile with curated links pointing to your latest blog posts, eCommerce stores, or other important profiles and pages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"429\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-24.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1345\" /><em>Gravatar links feature</em>\n\n\n\n<p>The way you display your links matters!

This allows you to add another way of monetizing your online presence, as well as gather money for charity and important causes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"446\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-25.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1346\" /><em>Adding payment links to your Gravatar profile</em>\n\n\n\n<p>Connect with websites like <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paypal.android.p2pmobile&hl=en_US\">PayPal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/\">Patreon</a>, <a href=\"https://venmo.com/\">Venmo</a>, <a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/\">Bitcoin</a>, <a href=\"https://litecoin.org/\">Litecoin</a>, and <a href=\"https://dogecoin.com/\">Dogecoin</a> in seconds!

For photographers, this is a great place to put some of your work.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast, which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, understanding the European Accessibility Act and it&#8217;s impact on websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head over to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Rian Rietveld. Rian is a web accessibility specialist from the Netherlands. As a freelance accessibility consultant, she works for NL Design Systems, the WordPress agency Level Level, and the form plugin Gravity Forms. She also teaches at the online learning platform, The A11Y Collective. She loves to share her knowledge at WordCamps meetups workshops and accessibility conferences worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we talk about the accessibility requirements of the European Accessibility Act or EAA, which will be enforced on June the 28, 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This legislation mandates that public service websites, products and services be accessible to all people. Rian clarifies the key aspects of the EAA, particularly focusing on websites, but we also touch upon other areas such as apps and PDFs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She emphasizes the importance of ensuring accessibility, not only because of the legal requirements, but also due to the moral obligation to include individuals with disabilities who access the web using a variety of different mechanisms, such as screen readers and keyboards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss practical ways to achieve web accessibility. For example, using default accessible themes in vanilla WordPress, and writing accessible content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rian also highlights the need for constant monitoring and training within teams to maintain accessibility standards, especially focusing on keyboard accessibility and color contrast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial incentives for making websites accessible are another point we talk about, as accessible websites can lead to increased revenue by catering to a broader audience, including the 20% of the population that relies on accessible websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally Rian points out that an accessible website can significantly impact SEO and customer engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast we talk about the importance of having an accessibility statement for websites in Europe, the differences in the requirements between the EU and other parts of the world, and the benefits of hiring a professional to conduct an accessibility audit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also addresses exemptions for small companies, but notes the overall benefit of compliance for reaching more customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the implications of the European Accessibility Act, and how to make your website more inclusive, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Rian Rietveld.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Rian Rietveld. Hello, nice to meet you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Thank you. for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;re very welcome. So we are at WordCamp Europe 2024. We are in the city of Torino. This is my first interview, so it&#8217;s an absolute pleasure having you on the podcast. We&#8217;re going to talk a little bit about a topic which Rian is mentioning at this conference. Do you want to just tell us a little bit about who you are before we get stuck into accessibility?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:24] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> My name is Rian Rietveld, and I&#8217;m from the Netherlands. I&#8217;m an accessibility expert. At the moment I&#8217;m freelance, and I&#8217;m working on various projects. One is the NL Design System that&#8217;s for the Dutch government, where I write documentation and guidelines for government websites, how to create accessible forms. And I also work for the WordPress agency Level Level, and for Gravity Forms, the WordPress forms plugin. And I give in-house trainings to companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> This is a topic which is probably, well, we&#8217;ll get into it, but there&#8217;s probably a whole load of legal stuff that we&#8217;ll end up talking about. And I just want to clear up at the beginning, do you have a background as a lawyer, or anything like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:04] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> No, I am not a lawyer, and I want to emphasise that everything I say is from the accessibility point of view, and not from the legal point of view. If you have questions really about a legal implications for your company, hire an expert in legislation for accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so I guess good to get out the way right at the beginning. Nevertheless, you&#8217;ve got a lot of expertise in this area. Your talk is called the European Accessibility Act. I would imagine we&#8217;ll probably call that EAA from this point. Well, I don&#8217;t know which is quicker, to be honest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the EAA, the European Accessibility Act is a piece of legislation, which I think is coming around in the year 2025. It seems like it&#8217;s a very big and important piece of legislation for people working with websites. Do you just want to tell us a little bit about what it is? Just what it is to begin with, and then we&#8217;ll get into who it affects, and how it affects people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:55] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> In 2016, the EU member states agreed to make public service websites accessible. For example, government websites. And in 2019, they agreed on the directive to make also products and services accessible. And each member state has to implement that directive into their own legislation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, each member state must already have that put in their law. So actually, that legislation should already be implemented with the member states. The Dutch government only did that two months ago. Some countries didn&#8217;t even do that yet. Other countries have that really nicely in order. So it depends a bit on the member state, but they all agreed that it will be enforced in 2025. June 28th, 2025. So it&#8217;s in one year, and then it will be enforced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what they agree on, that all services and products need to be accessible. And that&#8217;s a whole bunch of products like computers, operating systems, ATMs, ticket machines. And for services, it&#8217;s websites, e-commerce, the 111 emergency number. It&#8217;s a list of products and services that need to be accessible for people with a disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it&#8217;s not bound, this legislation is very much not bound just to websites, although that&#8217;s obviously our area of expertise. It&#8217;s any sort of interface, so an ATM is a perfect example. You know, you want to go and get money out of the machine, and obviously if you have an issue which prevents you doing that in the, and I&#8217;m putting air quotes, the normal way, that machine needs to be, by 2025, June 2025, that machine has to be accessible. And we can explore what that might mean for an ATM, as well as a website in a moment. But that&#8217;s the moment. That&#8217;s the day it&#8217;s got to be done?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:44] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> It should already be a law in the countries, but then it will be enforced. So that&#8217;s the deadline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so the expectation is that people are working towards this, and it&#8217;s not like you start thinking about it in June 2025. Yeah, it needs to be done. That work needs to be finished, because at that point the enforcement can happen. And we can get on to the enforcement, actually, let&#8217;s sort of pivot to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re in Italy at the moment, which is a member of the EU. I come from the UK, which made a decision several years ago to leave the EU. And I imagine there&#8217;ll be a bunch of people listening to this, I don&#8217;t know, in Australia, in New Zealand, in India, in America, does it affect them in any way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re an ATM manufacturer, I guess you might be shipping ATM machines to Italy. But certainly with a website, if I have a website which is based in the US, well, there&#8217;s nothing preventing me, as a user in the EU, from accessing that website. So where do the boundaries lie? What is the jurisdiction? Is there a boundary? Does it neatly encapsulate the EU, or do we need to worry wherever we are?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:49] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Well, that&#8217;s the web. The web is worldwide. So if you sell services or products to an EU member state, then your website or product needs to be accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You specifically said if you sell, so you used the word sell there. What if you have a website which is, oh I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s just say you have a blog, for example, or you have a brochure website, which is nothing to do with selling a thing. It&#8217;s just a hobby of some kind. Let&#8217;s call it that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:16] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Of course, but you don&#8217;t have to. If you sell items, services, or products, then you need to be accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it&#8217;s bound up with the transaction of money. If money is moving from one point to another point, and any of that touches the EU, then you need to be compliant by June 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:34] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What I&#8217;m taking from that then is that, if you are an international company, and you are selling anything into the EU, you can&#8217;t ignore this, even though you are in a country where the jurisdiction, if you like, you might think it doesn&#8217;t affect you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How could that jurisdiction possibly affect you though? So for example, let&#8217;s say that I am an American company, and I&#8217;m selling things, and Europeans are buying them. What possible thing could the EU do to an American citizen? Is there some relationship in law that you know of? And again, I&#8217;ll just emphasise that I know you&#8217;re not a lawyer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:07] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Well, that&#8217;s the big question, nobody knows yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:10] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> And what will happen, will it be a sue culture like in the US. Or will it be someone complaining, and take it to a local court? I have no idea. That&#8217;s kind of a tin of worms, because each country implements the legislation on a bit different way. For example, Germany has a very strict legislation. Maybe other people only stick to what is needed. It&#8217;s a tin of worms. And how it&#8217;ll be implemented, and how it&#8217;ll be enforced, we just have to see what happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I guess it will be interesting. Do you know though if people are lining up? How can I describe this without sounding controversial. In certain parts of the world, there&#8217;s this phrase which I hear from time to time and it&#8217;s ambulance chasing lawyers. And it&#8217;s the idea that lawyers find things where there&#8217;s a problem, and they go after them, maybe not for ethical reasons, or moral reasons, or whatever it may be, but it&#8217;s just because there&#8217;s a pot of money that they could get. Do you have any intuition as to whether lawyers in the EU are kind of ramping up their posture in terms of the EAA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:11] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> That&#8217;s not a culture in Europe at all, because for government website you need at the moment have an accessibility statement where you say, I&#8217;m aiming for, for example, the web content accessibility guidelines, version 2.1, level AA. This is what still needs to be done. This is the roadmap, and this is where you can file an issue. That&#8217;s an accessibility statement. And you already put what&#8217;s wrong on your website. And that will be hard to do in the US, because that gives a lawyer like a checklist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you have a good support system in place. First, someone needs to complain, and you need to respond on that and say, okay, I&#8217;m going to fix that. But if you ignore complaints and just say, oh, there&#8217;s disabled people, I&#8217;m not interested in that. That will trigger a lawsuit I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in Europe, you have to have an accessibility statement explaining what still needs to be done. And that&#8217;s a big issue I think for US companies, because they legally cannot do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So does that statement need to be published online, or it be a document that you just have in a file, in a drawer gathering dust?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:21] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> It has to be on your website, an accessibility statement. Yeah, it gives information about, what are you doing? What are you aiming for? What are you working on? And also, how people can report an issue. And that&#8217;s important if you are a client and you cannot use someone&#8217;s website, and you have the courtesy to actually tell that, okay, I cannot use your website because I have this, and this issue. You have to take these people seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So if you have to put that online, presumably it&#8217;s possible to go and find guidance about websites, in order to start ticking off those boxes, to be able to say, yeah, we have done that one, and we have done that one, but we have yet to begin this process. Those kind of documents are available, easy to access. Do you have a URL which you can just pop out of your head to do with that, where you would go and find those kind of things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:07] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> If you have a website, you let an accessible expert or firm do an audit. And in the audit you state what is wrong, right, and what is wrong. And that is a document you can link to. Is that what you mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think so. So you are advocating that, if you are not entirely sure, in other words, it sounds like, if you don&#8217;t have a legal team who are up on this, and understand all of this, you are saying hire a professional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:31] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Yes, please. Well, you have to do an audit by a professional. And a professional has to do an audit on your website, as a basement measurement, and you work from there. You fix the issues from there. And maybe if all the issues are fixed, you can redo the audit, and publish that on your website. But it gives you a state of the accessibility of your website at that moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So I&#8217;m imagining a, almost like a tick sheet with, there&#8217;s this, and this, and this, and I&#8217;ve to tick that, but I haven&#8217;t ticked that. Are there certain things on that tick sheet, things that you need to do in a certain order? And again, obviously you know the caveat about you not being a lawyer, and what have you. But, are there certain things that are more important? Can you get away with just ticking one box? Do the very tiniest amount, and still say, well, look we&#8217;ve made a start, it&#8217;s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:18] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> No, you have to say, I&#8217;m aiming for WCAG, it&#8217;s a web content and accessibility guidelines, version 2.1 AA, or 2.2 AA. And then you have to meet a couple of success criteria. Your images have alternative text, your videos have captioning. You have to meet all those to comply to WCAG, and to comply to the European Accessibility Act requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you fail some, you need to fix those to comply completely. There are not many websites that comply a hundred percent. There&#8217;s always something missing. So it&#8217;s utopia to say, oh, my website is perfectly accessible. Website is a work in progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, given that businesses can be one person, or they could be 50,000 people. Does any of that factor in? So if I am an individual employee, I am selling something, so I know that I have to take this seriously. Does the size of the business in any way affect how much I have to do by a certain date?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I can imagine a company of the size of, oh I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s say Amazon, or Google, or something along those lines, where they&#8217;ve got gigantic resources, and they can really fairly, straightforwardly put teams of people onto this project. I&#8217;m kind of imagining, in a fair and just world, there would be an expectation that they do more than the one person business, who just started up recently, and has got a million other things to do to keep their business going. Is there any sense of that, or is it, no, it&#8217;s a absolute flat level playing field, we all have to do the same?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:49] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Thankfully, there&#8217;s an exception for small companies. If you have less than 10 employees, and you have a revenue less than 2 million euros, you don&#8217;t need to comply. You can, of course, because it&#8217;s very good for your revenue, but you don&#8217;t need to comply to that rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I hadn&#8217;t written this question down, but that was an interesting thing that you just said. You just said that it will help your revenue, or it&#8217;s good for your revenue. And I&#8217;ve heard this being talked about before, that the people out there online, who require an accessible website, that the money in their pockets, the size of that cohort of peoples, the finances that they&#8217;ve got available is pretty large. And so if you do this work, even if you don&#8217;t need to, it could be very, very economically good for your business. So I&#8217;m just going to throw that back. Do you have anything to say about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:37] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Oh, I totally agree. And the population is getting older and older, so more and more people need an accessible website. Good color contrast, a logical order of the information. I think, if you build for everyone, then you just have more customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 20% of all people need some kind of accessibility. So if you just throw away 20% of your people, of your customers, that&#8217;s a large amount of number. And those are what you said, people who have money and want to buy something from you, and you just block the door for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s interesting. So, I think we&#8217;re all carrying around a mobile phone. We&#8217;ve all got this device in our pockets, which enables us to buy anything at any moment. And if you are closing the door, it&#8217;s literally like having a shop with a front door, but you&#8217;ve locked the door, and closed the windows, and pulled the curtains, and nobody can peer inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:28] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> What I found interesting is that there is a lot of money in SEO. You want all those people coming to your website, and then you say to 20%, okay, you are not allowed. So you throw away 20% of your SEO budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Really interesting. So 20% would be the kind of figure that we&#8217;re playing with. So there&#8217;s not only a legal obligation to do it, and we can talk about whether there&#8217;s a moral obligation in a moment. But there is definitely a financial incentive to doing this. And that, I think, is a piece of the conversation which doesn&#8217;t often get raised. And if, by doing a series of tasks, and it may be hard, and it may be arduous, but if you get these tasks complete, you may see an uptick in your revenue. So that&#8217;s kind of interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:08] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Yeah, it is part of your quality. You want to make your website responsive, secure, and good performance. That are all things that make a good website. Also add accessibility. It&#8217;s part of the quality of your work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is there a reason this kind of legislation hasn&#8217;t happened many years ago? Is it that the people who are now having an expectation that they can get online, did they just not have a voice until more recently? Because I can imagine that, if you require an accessible version of the internet, in the past years, you just wouldn&#8217;t have used the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you didn&#8217;t have a way to say, well, okay, this bit doesn&#8217;t work, this bit doesn&#8217;t work, because the whole thing was just broken. So you never got to see inside, you never got to peel back the curtain, and see what amazing things there are in the internet. So it&#8217;s kind of curious to me how we&#8217;ve got to 2025, and we&#8217;re still talking about this subject. We could have tackled it a decade or more ago, probably.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:03] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Well, it&#8217;s so hard to even get the government accessible. That took years, and years, and years. And now, even in the Netherlands, about 3% of the website for the government is totally accessible. The rest has still issues. It&#8217;s hard work because it needs training, it needs awareness, it needs people who decide about the finances to give the resources for training and for development. It&#8217;s a question of awareness, and that&#8217;s getting now better and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I guess if you are, so I&#8217;ll take the example of a wheelchair user. If you are standing on the street, and you see somebody using a wheelchair, and they want to get into a physical shop, and there are some steps, and nothing but steps, you see the problem. It&#8217;s right there in front of your eyes. This person cannot get into that shop. That&#8217;s a disaster. So we built the ramps. But this is kind of hidden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:53] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Yes. When you are young and everything works, your body, you just test a website with a mouse and your eyes, and you say, okay, it works. And you have no idea that someone who gets the website read out loud, has no clue about what&#8217;s happening, or uses the website with a keyboard, cannot open the menu, for example. It works for the mouse, it works for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only recently in the Netherlands, accessibility is taught on the schools for developers and designers. That&#8217;s only now starting. So everybody has to teach themselves who is a developer at the moment, or gets training, or maybe companies train their people. It&#8217;s only starting at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So we had decision makers who didn&#8217;t make these decisions, plus we had people coming into the industry who just didn&#8217;t know. But now we&#8217;re at the beginning of that journey. This is part of the education, so hopefully, yeah okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:44] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Yes, education is the key, I think. We need to educate developers, designers, and also managers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So with the best will in the world, even if 50% of the people, 60%, 70%, 80%, whatever it may be, of the people listen to this podcast, and they say, yep, I&#8217;m going todo all the right things. There&#8217;s definitely going to be a proportion of people who say, leave it till tomorrow, we&#8217;ll leave it for another year. We&#8217;ll never get caught, we a tiny fish in a big pond of websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What can the EU actually do? And when I wrote the question out, I wrote, what stick can the EU use? We have this carrot and stick approach in the English language, where you hit something with a stick to get it to behave, or you offer it a carrot, a treat if you like, to get it to behave. So, is there any of that? Is there any stick that the EU can bring to bear? And also, are there any carrots?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:30] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Well, that&#8217;s the big question. I cannot look in the future. So, what will happen in 2025? Everyone in the accessibility world is looking at, so what will happen? We don&#8217;t know. Will there be a strict legislation? Will nothing happen, like with the GDPR? Oh, panic, and then nothing happens. Or will we actually be enforced, and will there be fines for companies? I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope this will be a game changer, because there&#8217;s a lot of publicity on this. And there&#8217;s no easy, quick fix. Like the GDPR, you put a cookie banner, and you&#8217;re done. Rework your website, you need to rebuild your website, look at your work. And that&#8217;s a lot more work than just adding a cookie banner. And if there will be implications, I hope so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you know if on the books, in theory, there&#8217;s a stick? Is there anything, and again, I know you are not a lawyer, but do you know if there&#8217;s anything in the legislation which could be used? Whether or not it will be used aggressively or, you know, more of a soft touch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:26] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Well, it depends on the member states. Each member state can decide, in their own legislation, what the fine will be, what the stick will be. So, not every country has decided on what to do yet. Some countries have, and some other countries none. Ireland, the law in Ireland that went viral in the accessibility world, you can go to jail. Yes, you can get fined and go to jail. Other countries may have no implications at all. If you can go to jail in Ireland, it may be not really happening, but it&#8217;s in the legislation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;d be curious to see, in the same way that financial laws, you know, if you can move your business to a country where there&#8217;s very little tax, we know what happens. The countries, there&#8217;s lots of companies, they suddenly set up an office there, and they become, I wonder if the same thing would happen. All the companies move away from Ireland from the risk of going to prison, or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, tell me about this then. So we know that you have until June 2025 to get this work done. Tell us about the more sort of moral aspect. And what I&#8217;m talking about there is, it&#8217;s going to be difficult to do this because we&#8217;re an audio podcast, and really it would be nice to sort of see some of this stuff on a screen, but we&#8217;ll just have to use words to describe it. Is there a kind of, a moral aspect to this? Can you describe what it may, in some limited circumstance, look like, or feel like, or sound like for people on the web?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know that&#8217;s really hard to encapsulate. But if we took the example of somebody who is completely blind. So that&#8217;s something I think we can all understand. You know, if you&#8217;ve got perfect sight, you can close your eyes, and you can hold a mouse in your hand, and you can then try to imagine what the internet would be like. And already, just in my own mind, I&#8217;m picturing it&#8217;s a complete black box. I can&#8217;t see it anymore. What are the ways that people are accessing the web without normal, air quotes, mouse, keyboard, eyes, ears, format?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:16] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> There&#8217;s so many different ways. Some people are deaf and blind, so they depend on a braille display. They get all the text in pins, braille letters. Some people use the keyboard only, and that actually is a requirement. You should be able to use a website with a keyboard only. And some people use a stick in their mouth, if they cannot use their hands. And they can access keyboard, or display by that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people have a straw in their mouth, and they can use the straw to blow in that, and puff it&#8217;s called. And that, way it&#8217;s a zero and one, so that way you can use the website also. Stephen Hawkin, he used electronic device on his chin. He used a device on his cheek, where he can, just by moving one muscle, operate his voice control. There are people who speak to the computer without any hands. So many different ways. And it only works if you code your website properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right, that&#8217;s the key point. All of that bit that you just said, if you just listen to that, you would think, oh, well it&#8217;s fine then, people can put a stick in their mouth, and they can use that, or they can blow, or they can have something attached to their face, or they can speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course that&#8217;s not it. It&#8217;s that, if the website isn&#8217;t built to enable those kind of technologies, you are faced with something border lining on, just massively infuriating to use, impossible to use. So it&#8217;s not like, oh, I&#8217;ve got this assistive technology, suddenly everything is perfect. You have to rebuild the website so that the assistive technology can get through the website, and you&#8217;ve got clear markers, and it&#8217;s all built correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:52] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Actually, the web by itself, HTML, what the website is made of, is accessible. All the extra stuff they put into it, making it work only with the mouse, all the extra effects, that makes it inaccessible. So learn HTML properly. If you can use HTML well, you already have a lot of accessibility for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So again, this is a question that I didn&#8217;t have written down, but it&#8217;d be interesting to explore. If you were just using pure and exact HTML, everything would work. But we&#8217;re at a conference where we&#8217;re using a CMS, and I just have the question, how does WordPress do with any of this? Is it out of the box?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, okay, I&#8217;m not imagining that we&#8217;re throwing a bunch of plugins in. Ignore that, because obviously that would introduce a million and one different ways of making it inaccessible, or accessible. But if we just took vanilla WordPress, and installed directly from wordpress.org, and we were to write posts, and pages, and what have you with that, with just the core blocks, how are we doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:54] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> If you use the default teams, 21, 22, that kind of themes, those are all accessible. If you use those with vanilla WordPress, you&#8217;re pretty good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing is the content. You need to write also accessible content. Good heading structure, don&#8217;t call all the links, click here. Add alternative text to your images. If you do that too, you can create an accessible website. It&#8217;s perfectly possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Now the interesting thing there is, it feels like we just had a conversation where, a person without accessibility needs has a WordPress website, and they&#8217;re creating the content for people who have accessibility needs. How does it work the other way around? How does WordPress behave as an editing, content creating experience for people with accessibility needs? I think that&#8217;s going to be a harder question to answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:44] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> It needs work. I will keep it to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, okay. There&#8217;s work to be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:47] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> There&#8217;s work to be done. And we have an excellent accessibility team, and they are doing a great job. They need more people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. I mean, we&#8217;ve thrown in, in the last five or six years, a very complicated, well, not complicated once you&#8217;ve understood it. It&#8217;s a complicated editing experience. There&#8217;s lots of moving parts and there&#8217;s menus over here, and there&#8217;s options, which if you click in something, other things appear, and what have you, and it&#8217;s all very visual. My interpretation of that is entirely visual. I move my mouse, and it&#8217;s complicated. So there&#8217;s work to be done, the long and the short of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We didn&#8217;t really touch on this, but I do want to slightly. Is your website ever going to be complete? Even if you are Google, and you have this giant team, where you&#8217;ve got people, you know, a hundred people on this every day, for all of the things that they do. Is this journey ever complete, or is this shifting sand? Is it that the legislation is changing all the time, or there&#8217;s just too many things to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, are you allowed to, I know we had this sort of tick box exercise, are there some things that you could recommend to begin with if you&#8217;re on this journey? So let&#8217;s take the first bit. Can you ever say that website over there is complete?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:57] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Well, yes you can, but a website is evolving. New content is added, new features are added, and all those need to be checked all the time. If you have a new content manager and they don&#8217;t know about adding alternative texts, it breaks your accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, good point, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:14] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> So everybody on the team must stay focused and trained. If you have a new content manager, train them in accessibility. If you add content, then the accessibility is vulnerable because it needs to be added accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Sorry, just to interrupt you. That&#8217;s interesting because I&#8217;m imagining a site that, let&#8217;s say I&#8217;ve got a site and it&#8217;s 10 years old, and I&#8217;ve got 10,000 blog posts, and all of them contain, let&#8217;s say video because you mentioned that videos ought to have captions. Do I need to go back and do all of those 10,000 videos?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:44] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> That&#8217;s interesting because you can, in your accessibility statement, say, okay, from January 1st 2024, I&#8217;m going to add captioning to all my videos, and then do that also. And before that, if you need content that is added to the video, or if you need captioning on a video, or need the content on an older video, email us and we&#8217;ll provide it to you. So you don&#8217;t have to go through all that content, and go through the videos, and the alternative text. But if someone needs that content, you must be able to provide it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So we know that our website really, in the real world, the website&#8217;s never going to be complete if you are, like most people, are tweaking the website, and you&#8217;ve got people creating content, and new pages. So you&#8217;ve got to be constantly mindful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, I think we&#8217;ve learned that you can pick your journey a little bit. You can say, okay, I&#8217;m going to tackle this piece of the jigsaw, and this piece. And treat it as a journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:41] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> That&#8217;s the roadmap you&#8217;re taking. And first start with keyboard accessibility. That&#8217;s a main feature. If your keyboard accessibility is okay, it works with almost all assistive technology. And then go through color contrast. And that&#8217;s the easiest thing. If your color contrast isn&#8217;t right, it&#8217;s just tweaking your CSS. That&#8217;s a quick fix. Go for the quick fixes, and for the keyboard accessibility. I think that&#8217;s the best way to approach the roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s a good way to start. Okay, that&#8217;s perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does this affect anything apart from websites? So I&#8217;m imagining situations where, oh I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s say that I&#8217;m sending out email and it&#8217;s nothing to do with my website, it&#8217;s a third party piece of software, or I&#8217;ve got, I don&#8217;t know, a CRM system, where customers can log in and see their orders and things like that. So it&#8217;s outside of the website. Does all of this need to be accessible? So we&#8217;ve been talking about websites, and at the beginning we began with ATMs, so I&#8217;m guessing the answer is yes, if anybody can interact with that thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:38] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> If a client can do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But there might not be any money changing hands with that thing. So I&#8217;m imagining the website, let&#8217;s say that you&#8217;re a website and you&#8217;re selling things, you&#8217;ve got a company with enough employees, you are based in Europe, and you are selling things. So we know you are definitely, the European Accessibility Act, we know that you are under that. But if you are, I don&#8217;t know, sending out email, and there&#8217;s no transaction in that email, it&#8217;s not anything to do with sales, but your company is selling things, how does that work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:07] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Well, emails are not really mentioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:09] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> It&#8217;s a good way to do it because it&#8217;s communication with your client, and you better make sure your client understands your message. So that&#8217;s good part of your best practice, of your good practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But it&#8217;s not specifically tied into the legislation. In theory, you could avoid it. That&#8217;s kind of fascinating that that never got pulled in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:25] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> In websites?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, just websites. That&#8217;s fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:28] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> And apps, and also electronic documents. If you have PDFs on your website, they need to be accessible too. And that&#8217;s a good reason to get rid of your PDFs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, thank you. Would you just tell us a little bit about where we can find you on the internet? Obviously, you are very keen on this subject. I&#8217;m guessing that part of your business might be to do with this as well. So just tell us a little bit about where we can find you, and what kind of things you are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:50] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> You can find me on rianrietveld.com. I&#8217;m doing consultancy and I write documentation. I also train people for web accessibility. If you want an online training, you can go to the A11Y Collective, that&#8217;s a11y-collective.com. We have a couple of online trainings in web accessibility there. There is, for the US WebAIM, webaim.org, and that&#8217;s a large website with excellent information about accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also on gov.uk, that&#8217;s from the British government, they publish excellent information about accessibility. And if you Google, well, there are many, many companies that provide accessibility consultancy, and also training. Deque is one of them. So there are plenty of them about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I will make sure that I dig all of those URLs out, and I will paste them on the WP Tavern page, so you&#8217;ll be able to find them there, along with a complete transcript of this episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:47] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> That will be great. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, you are very welcome. So thank you Rian Rietveld. I appreciate you chatting to me on the podcast today. I hope that you have a good WordCamp EU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:55] <strong>Rian Rietveld:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Rian Rietveld.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rian is a web accessibility specialist from the Netherlands. As a freelance accessibility consultant she works for NL Design System, the WordPress agency Level Level and the form plugin Gravity Forms. She also teaches at the online learning platform The A11Y Collective. She loves to share her knowledge on WordCamps, meetups, workshops and accessibility conferences worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we talk about the accessibility requirements of the European Accessibility Act or EAA, which will be enforced by June 28th, 2025. This legislation mandates that public service websites, products, and services be accessible to all people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rian clarifies the key aspects of the EAA, particularly focusing on websites, but we also touch upon other areas such as apps, and PDFs. She emphasises the importance of ensuring accessibility not only because of the legal requirements but also due to the moral obligation to include individuals with disabilities who access the web using a variety of different mechanisms such as screen readers and keyboards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss practical ways to achieve web accessibility, for example using default accessible themes in vanilla WordPress and writing accessible content. Rian also highlights the need for constant monitoring and training within teams to maintain accessibility standards, especially focusing on keyboard accessibility and colour contrast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial incentives for making websites accessible are another point we talk about, as accessible websites can lead to increased revenue by catering to a broader audience, including the 20% of the population that relies on accessible websites. Additionally, Rian points out that an accessible website can significantly impact SEO and customer engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast, we talk about the importance of having an accessibility statement for websites in Europe, the differences in the requirements between the EU and other parts of the world, and the benefits of hiring a professional to conduct an accessibility audit. She also addresses exemptions for small companies, but notes the overall benefit of compliance for reaching more customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in understanding the implications of the European Accessibility Act and how to make your websites more inclusive, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2024/07/03/the-european-accessibility-act-explained/\">The European Accessibility Act explained</a> on WordPress.tv</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nldesignsystem.nl/\">NL Design System</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://level-level.com/\">Level Level agency</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gravityforms.com/\">Gravity Forms</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\">WCAG guidelines</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rianrietveld.com/\">Rian&#8217;s website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.a11y-collective.com/\">The A11Y Collective</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://webaim.org/\">WebAIM</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-and-tools-for-digital-accessibility\">Guidance and tools for digital accessibility</a> from gov.uk</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.deque.com/\">Deque</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Jul 2024 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"Do The Woo Community: Walking the Floor at WCEU Talking Accessibility with Taeke Reijenga\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=84570\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://dothewoo.io/walking-the-floor-at-wceu-talking-accessibility-with-taeke-reijenga/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25282:\"<div class=\"wp-block-group has-border-color has-light-gray-background-color has-background has-small-font-size has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-7 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"has-secondary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-df14f0e3ece767c29248940486a8055c\">This show is sponsored by&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-3 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-background-color has-background wp-container-content-1 has-global-padding is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-2 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"1224\" height=\"1224\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Hostinger_Vertical_Purple-e1668465093968.jpg?resize=1224%2C1224&ssl=1\" alt=\"Hostinger\" class=\"wp-image-73505\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-container-content-2\"><strong><a href=\"https://hostinger.com\">Hostinger</a></strong>: As a builder or an agency managing multiple sites, check out <strong>Hostinger</strong>.

This is Taeke, your host from the accessibility podcast. It&#8217;s just me today. I saw Anne-Mieke running around, which is understandable as she is one of the organizers of WordCamp Europe that we&#8217;re currently attending. We&#8217;re going to freestyle a bit, so I&#8217;ll just walk around and ask some people about accessibility: what it means for them, if it&#8217;s something that is part of their daily practice, if it&#8217;s new to them, anything. So let&#8217;s get started. Hey there, this is, let&#8217;s see, Manuela van Prooijen. How are you doing? Hi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manuela:<br />I am fine, thank you. This is quite a spread.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />It&#8217;s been a couple of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manuela:<br />Yes. The last time we met was at Porto WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />And that&#8217;s when you decided to move to Portugal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manuela:<br />That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s my home base now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Really cool. This is the Do the Woo accessibility podcast. So I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about accessibility. Is there anything that you do in your daily life that involves accessibility?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manuela:<br />Yeah. Over the past few years, I&#8217;ve developed training programs specifically for virtual assistants to bridge the gap between backend developers and marketing teams to provide a hands-on workforce for bridging accessibility gaps. So I have this program, and it&#8217;s very successful in the Netherlands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />So you&#8217;re basically training the new generation to help us out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manuela:<br />Yes. With the upcoming European Accessibility Act, it&#8217;s very important not just to have auditors or programmers, but people who can provide hands-on workforce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Yeah, that&#8217;s amazing. And I totally agree. I mean, I foresee a bit of an issue with this act coming up. At the moment that we are recording, this is one year and 14 days away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manuela:<br />Yes, it&#8217;s almost one year away, but it&#8217;s getting closer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />It&#8217;s getting closer. The clock is ticking. Next booth, I see a booth for Equalize Digital, and I know they do something with accessibility. Hi there. Who are you? What do you do at Equalize Digital?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Hello, I am Steve Jones. I am the CTO at Equalize Digital. We are an accessibility product and services company specializing in accessibility. We have a plugin called the Accessibility Checker that scans your websites for accessibility issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />And I heard something, and I see it on your booth. You landed an amazing client not too long ago, or maybe some time ago, but they launched not too long ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />They have a lot of things, but the client you&#8217;re speaking of is NASA. Last year, we were brought in as the accessibility team for the NASA project. NASA built a new website on top of WordPress, and we were lucky enough to be brought in to audit the code being developed by the Lone Rock Agency for the NASA website. It was an exciting time, and it actually has extended to just recently. We&#8217;ve still been doing some audits on that and providing accessibility feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />That&#8217;s amazing. Congrats on that. That&#8217;s a cool name to have in your portfolio, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />So is it just these big names that you work for? I imagine that the plugin is for anyone to install. Can you tell a little bit more about the plugin, what it does, and why I should install it on my website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Yeah, we don&#8217;t just do huge, awesome, interesting clients like NASA, although that is great. The bulk of our clients are medium to large agencies. We do a lot of enterprise website development that is accessible, and like you said, we have our Accessibility Checker plugin. This plugin has a full-featured free version available on WordPress.org. It sits inside your WordPress admin and evaluates your post or page for accessibility issues in real-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />So this really helps editorial teams in writing their content because they get immediate feedback, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Yes, it&#8217;s never enough to launch a website and say it&#8217;s accessible and then leave it. Especially WordPress websites. They&#8217;re a living, breathing machine. So accessibility is something that needs to be evaluated with every publish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />It&#8217;s not just about developers being trained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Content creators,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Content creators, designers. It&#8217;s a team effort. Is there anything you want to add or share with us? Otherwise, I&#8217;m going to move along and see if there are more sponsors here that do anything with accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />For any freelancers or agencies or large agencies out there, consider accessibility a priority. Put accessibility first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />I do have one last question. Why is it so important for you? Is it the law or is there a more ethical motivation? What brought you to accessibility as a niche?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Well, there is a legal aspect and an ethical aspect to it. Of course, a lot of companies do need to legally comply. The European Accessibility Act will be enacted next year. So there&#8217;s a lot in that respect. But there&#8217;s the ethical side too. At Equalize Digital, we lean more on the ethical side. It’s the right thing to do. Anybody should be able to use the internet. Societies across the world are becoming increasingly digital for basic tasks like getting medical supplies and filling out government paperwork. They shouldn&#8217;t be met with blockers along the way. They should be able to access and submit information as easily as people without any disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Yeah, totally agree. And it’s exactly the same philosophy that we live by. It’s more the ethical argument that weighs stronger than any law. It’s about democratizing publishing, making sure that the web is open and can be used by anyone in any situation, whether it’s a temporary or a more permanent one. In the end, we’ll all grow older.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Yeah, I mean, we’re building an internet for our future selves. We will get older, and we will have degenerative issues, eyesight issues typically. It’s funny that you bring up democratizing publishing because our CEO, Amber Hines, likes to say that we’re trying to democratize accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Thanks very much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Alright, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />And while I’m approaching the Do the Woo booth at WordCamp Europe, I see another amazing person that I want to ask some questions. We’re going to see an amazing talk by Fel about the European Accessibility Acts that we extensively discussed already. And I just ran into Bet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />Hey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Hey, Bet, how are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />I’m good. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />I’m good. How are you enjoying WordCamp Europe?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />I am enjoying it a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Yeah. What brought you here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />I get to talk to all kinds of people about accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Awesome. Just accessibility?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />Well, selling myself, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />What we’re doing. Well, sell yourself to the audience. Who are you? What do you do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />I’m Ben Hannon. I’m the CEO of AccessiCart. We do web accessibility for e-commerce and other folks too, but primarily e-commerce. We work on WordPress, Shopify, and Magento.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />And what does that mean, &#8220;we work on&#8221;?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />We do accessibility consulting and testing for those platforms, and then we can do remediations in WordPress, but not on the others. We tend to partner with agencies, working alongside them to identify issues, prioritize them, help them solve them, and retest and document everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />You guide them through the process with the aim of going from one project to the other or training them on the job and letting them go at some point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />Yes, we build up the skills of the developers there. We do some project work, project management for remediation, or consulting for a development project. But our bread and butter is doing accessibility maintenance plans. Accessibility can be affected by any kind of content change. Sometimes even a plugin update can make something inaccessible. So we work with them to monitor and work on the sites continuously. For many, it’s about identifying and solving a few problems every month, step by step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />And that gets them documentation that shows they’re making incremental progress. It’s about showing they’re taking it seriously, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />Exactly. And having those documented reports makes it more affordable for many people to begin thinking about doing it in smaller chunks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />You’re from the US, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />Yes, I’m from Oregon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />So you deal with the Americans with Disabilities Act mainly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />Yes, but we also have clients who need to comply with EU laws.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />If you look at the European Accessibility Act and compare it to what’s already happening in the US under the ADA, do you see a difference?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />Yes, the EU law will have a much bigger impact. The ADA was enacted 40 years ago, before websites, so it wasn’t written for websites. Lawsuits are brought under the ADA, and courts usually say you have to remediate to WCAG 2.1 AA. But the EAA talks about those standards plus regular testing and reporting, which isn’t required in the US unless they have EU customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the European Accessibility Act is really an act about accessibility, and it’s up to the European countries to implement it into law. It’s inclusive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />Yes, and in some countries, like Germany, competitors can file a complaint, which really motivates people to get that competitive advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />I hope there’s enforcement and it’s taken seriously. From Europe, we look at the US and see it as the Wild West with the ADA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />Yes, the European Accessibility Act is friendlier but has a bigger impact. It’s about being inclusive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />With only one year to go, I’m a bit worried that we’re not ready for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />But there’s more awareness now. Agencies and clients are starting to realize they need to step up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />It’s a mindset. If we don’t feel it, if we don’t have the empathy to understand what it’s like not to be able to use the web, then…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />Exactly. If you’re lucky enough not to die suddenly, you’ll probably need accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Yes. Someone mentioned we’re building the accessible web for ourselves. We’ll all grow older and benefit from this. Thanks for the catch-up, Bet. Let’s see if we can get you on the show soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet:<br />That would be great. Thanks a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />My name is Ash Shaw. I’m from Lightspeed WordPress Agency. We did some testing using BrowserStack accessibility tools and PageSpeed Lighthouse. We’ve been fixing issues within our free open-source theme listed on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />What’s it called?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />NSX Design. None of our software in the past was accessible. After we purchased courses from the A11Y Collective, we skilled up in accessibility. My designer, developers, and I all skilled up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />That’s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />It made a huge difference to our understanding of accessibility and compatibility. We have clients worldwide, but mainly in South Africa. Now that we have a base that is accessible, we can build accessible sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />You’ve just taken the first steps towards full accessibility in your client work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Yes. We’re using tools like Stark as a browser extension and in Figma. We’re dealing with contrast issues, button sizes, font sizes, etc. Yesterday, I worked with the accessibility table at Contributor Day and got input on our theme issues. Some issues are in Core or WooCommerce or Gravity Forms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />I know there are issues in WordPress and WooCommerce, but I also know people are taking it seriously. After WordCamp Europe, WooCommerce will work on their plugin and address 50-60 accessibility issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Yes, Amber Hinds is leading that. I reported the issues I found, and she’s logging them as GitHub issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Thank you for that contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />It was a fun day. I learned a lot. My developers struggled at first but eventually got it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />It takes time to go from awareness to practice. That’s why it’s important to start working on accessibility now, especially with the European Accessibility Act in mind. It’s only a year away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Now that we have this knowledge, every project we do will use these tools. We get free access to the BrowserStack accessibility tool, and I’ve recommended it to other users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />A lot more people will thank you for that suggestion because this is the Do the Woo podcast on accessibility. This will be broadcasted after WordCamp Europe. Thank you for all the tips and your experiences. I’m going to see if I can tackle a few more people and hear their stories about accessibility. Thanks a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ash:<br />Thanks, man. See you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Hello Ingrid. Can you tell us a little bit about what you’re doing here, what you’re promoting here at the Accessibility Collective booth?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ingrid:<br />We are an e-learning platform with courses for designers, developers, and content writers, mostly marketers, to ensure the web is fully accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Is there a lot of interest in the booth today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ingrid:<br />Yes, definitely. From frontend developers, backend developers, and plugin creators. It’s a diverse audience, which is fun to talk to about accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Who is the Accessibility Collective aimed at? Is it for a specific discipline?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ingrid:<br />It’s important for all disciplines creating or writing content for the web to ensure full accessibility. It’s a team effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />I see a potential candidate for a small interview. Hi Josepha. Can I ask you a couple of questions? This is the Accessibility Podcast from Do the Woo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha:<br />By some fluke of nature, we also have the current project ambassador from the TYPO3 Project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Wow, that’s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha:<br />You can ask us both a question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Can you tell me what accessibility, specifically web accessibility, means to you personally or professionally?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha:<br />I think the most important thing about accessibility that people often overlook is that it is a subset of usability. We are all just temporarily fully abled. Just because you feel accessibility doesn’t apply to you now, doesn’t mean it won’t later. It’s something we should all care about because we are a global project trying to make the world a better place, making commerce and access to cool stuff better and easier for more people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />That’s a great opinion. Thank you for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mathias:<br />My name is Mathias Bolt Lesniak. I am the project ambassador of TYPO3, a friendly cousin CMS to WordPress. We work together in the Open Website Alliance. My elevator pitch about accessibility is this: I once stood in front of an elevator in a hotel and pressed the button. The elevator came with a person inside who asked, “Where am I?” The elevator had braille everywhere, but the key card scanner wasn’t marked in braille. It’s an excellent example of how important accessibility is. You can’t just do it as an afterthought. You have to think through it the whole way. If you skip a step, you lose the visitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />You ruin the experience, you lose the visitor. It’s a great example, especially in digital accessibility for e-commerce. The whole store can be accessible, but maybe the marketing team forgot something, and the user experience is ruined. Thanks very much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mathias:<br />Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to this special episode of A<strong>ll Things WordPress and WooCommerce accessibility podcast</strong>, recorded live at WordCamp Europe.

AccessiCart, explains their approach to making e-commerce platforms like WordPress, Shopify, and Magento accessible, focusing on consulting, testing, and maintaining accessibility over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Building Accessible Foundations</strong>: Ash Shaw from Lightspeed WordPress Agency talks about their efforts to build accessible websites from the ground up, using tools like BrowserStack and Figma to address issues like color contrast and font sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Team Effort in Accessibility</strong>: Ingrid from the Accessibility Collective emphasizes that creating accessible web content requires collaboration across all disciplines, including designers, developers, and content writers, to ensure a fully inclusive web experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Holistic Accessibility Planning</strong>: Mathias Bolt Lesniak, the project ambassador of TYPO3, shares a real-world example illustrating the importance of thorough accessibility planning, stressing that skipping any step in the process can ruin the user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ethical and Legal Motivations</strong>: Several participants, including Steve Jones and Ben Hannon, highlight the dual motivations for accessibility—both ethical (making the web usable for everyone) and legal (complying with laws like the European Accessibility Act and the ADA in the US).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Future-proofing</strong>: The discussions underscore the importance of building an accessible web not just for current users but also for future generations, as everyone will benefit from accessible design as they age or face temporary or permanent disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul

Carl, how are you doing, man?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I had a good WordCamp EU, but I got Covid, so I&#8217;m slightly recovering from that now. I&#8217;ll be muting my phone so I can cough silently in my apartment, but otherwise, I&#8217;m doing quite well. How about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />While you were in Europe getting Covid, I had bronchitis in the US. It’s just been a fun month for respiratory things, evidently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah, apparently summer is now the time for respiratory issues. Usually, we&#8217;re from the north, so it&#8217;s a winter thing. Winter is when all the bugs come out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yes, unless you&#8217;re talking about cicadas, which have been recent. Those are the bugs that came out this summer for a lot of the Upper Midwest and a bunch of other places too. So that&#8217;s been fun. And we as developers, of course, know how to deal with bugs evidently. It’s been a very interesting month, watching some of the changes around Do the Woo. If you&#8217;ve missed that and you just come to listen to the dulcet tones of myself and Carl talking with developers about nerdy things,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />It&#8217;s mostly your dulcet tones. I don&#8217;t think my tones are dulcet at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Well, some people may be attracted to the accent, my friend. That being said, if you haven&#8217;t heard about the changes around Do the Woo, Bob did a great episode summarizing what shows there are now. We&#8217;re up to 12 shows, so I encourage you to check out some of those other shows if you haven&#8217;t yet. The most recent is our Enterprise WordPress and WooCommerce show, which is pretty cool, partnered with the Scale Consortium for that. So really cool stuff. But yeah, we&#8217;re growing and changing, and that&#8217;s always nice to see. This month we have decided to invite a friend I&#8217;ve known for a very long time now, Beka Rice, to join us here on the dev chat. Let&#8217;s start out, Beka, by introducing you a bit and seeing how you have been in the last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Yes, I am one of the lucky folks who did not get Covid from WordCamp Europe, so very grateful for that. I had enough respiratory illnesses this winter that I am glad to be done with it, but it&#8217;s good to see you guys again. As Zach noted, I&#8217;m Beka Rice. I&#8217;ve worked with WooCommerce since 2013, maybe even before that. It&#8217;s been a long time—since I think version 1.4 if I go back in time a bit. I was one of the original folks at SkyVerge; Max, Justin, and I were partners there. We worked at SkyVerge for a long time and were acquired by GoDaddy in 2020. I still worked in the Woo ecosystem but had a number of other responsibilities and projects I was working on there as well. I left earlier this year after a few years of doing some really cool stuff but wanted to be back working with a small team. So now I have reentered the Woo atmosphere and am very excited to be back doing specific work with a small team again at Kestrel. It was nice to reconnect with a lot of people at WCEU, so if you were one of them, it was very good to see you again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yeah, no, that&#8217;s quite a journey. I tell the story of how I got into WooCommerce—building a website for a record label I was part of, using the white light theme back in the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />It wasn&#8217;t Canvas?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />No, I used white light because it had the look that I was after. Those were very interesting days. One of my favorite parts of that time period was the fact that it was kind of the Wild West of WooCommerce. The fork had just happened recently, and we were all starting to adopt it and get into it. There was this Trello board with all these ideas for integrations and plugins, and people would go in there, claim the things they wanted to build, and then build them. Suddenly, we had this ecosystem of plugins and extensions for WooCommerce that started to grow. You and Max and Justin were very early in all of that. I know there were some cards that were claimed that you didn&#8217;t end up building. One in particular was taken over by someone else when the bandwidth just wasn&#8217;t there to do it. I think that was subscriptions, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Well, I would have to ask them if that was a card they had talked about or not, but there were a number in the early days. I think &#8220;Wild West&#8221; is a great way to describe it because the community was so small at that point that you had a couple handfuls of developers who had gotten into WooCommerce, but there weren&#8217;t very many. There were more integrations and ideas and extensions than could simply be built by that small group of people. So certainly Max and Justin were earlier with that. I wasn&#8217;t developing anything at that time myself; I was more so doing documentation and support. But yeah, there were a lot of things that got built, some things that didn&#8217;t, some ideas that probably were big misses still. But with subscriptions in particular, that landing with Brent was probably a great thing all around. You can&#8217;t be mad about a really fantastic piece of software that someone else built.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />I don&#8217;t think so. Honestly, the ecosystem wouldn&#8217;t have Action Scheduler if that hadn&#8217;t happened. For those who don&#8217;t know, WooCommerce Subscriptions is what birthed Action Scheduler, which is the way WooCommerce handles asynchronous tasks in the background. Brent Shepherd and his team did all the work to make that happen. I still have my blue T-shirt, the collaborative T-shirt between SkyVerge and Prospress, the Subscriptions team. One of my profile photos that I frequently go back to is me wearing that shirt with a leather sport coat over it next to a performing arts venue that&#8217;s now five minutes from my house. It’s one of my favorite pictures, and it was taken by my former business partner, Scott.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />A lot of fond memories of those times for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />We were still technically just exiting that Wild West era when the first WooConf happened, and we all got together in Austin. What year was that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />The second WooConf in Austin? Yeah, I think it was 2015.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />You and I both spoke at 2017; we were secondary keynotes then, so that was Seattle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />We&#8217;re testing our memories here, Zach. But yes, there was one in San Francisco early on that was much smaller, then Austin, and then Seattle. All were really wonderful conferences. I would love to see something like that again in the Woo ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I tell them all the time, every WooCommerce event. Zach can&#8217;t go, but I crash all the WooCommerce events and consistently remind them they should have a dedicated WooCommerce event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />A few people are calling for that now, and it&#8217;s a common thing. We miss it because it was our chance as a community to not only gather and be a community of builders and developers in one location but also a way to show off the cool stuff that&#8217;s been happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Yeah, it’s hard in Woo, right? With it being decentralized, you don&#8217;t always have a view of what other people are doing. There&#8217;s no one source, not even Automattic, that knows every WooCommerce site out there. I think it was super valuable to see that across the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />For me, it was more networking. I was trying to find agencies that specialize in that or people that worked with it more because it&#8217;s hard at WordCamps. It’s people doing a bit of everything, so it&#8217;s hard to find the people that specialize in that. I&#8217;m actually really thankful I broke in because Bob sent me an invite that he couldn&#8217;t go to the first WordCamp Asia in Bangkok, and that got the ball rolling for me. A lot of WooCommerce people hang on the sidelines a bit at these WordCamps, so it&#8217;s hard to know who specializes in it, what the big agencies are, the big plugin companies, the big extension companies, who&#8217;s doing cool stuff. It’s just really hard to find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yeah, it is, and I think Brian has done a great job with WooSesh, trying to keep some of that alive virtually, but virtual events don&#8217;t compare to being in person with a group of people. It&#8217;s still fun. I enjoy them. I love what WooSesh and WordSesh have done for the community, but it&#8217;s different than gathering in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Some conferences, like WPCampus, do a hybrid. I got accepted to speak this year but couldn&#8217;t go physically, so I declined because I&#8217;m like you. I think the physical connection aspect, the physical networking in person, is way better than virtual. So if that&#8217;s your goal, it&#8217;s really important. Conferences, it’s hard when you do purely virtual. I think it&#8217;s good that some events are trying to do this hybrid format at least to accommodate the speakers because it&#8217;s also about the speakers. It costs a lot of money. I think WPCampus actually has a bit of a stipend, but WordCamps don&#8217;t. So there’s financial accessibility, a question of how comfortable you are traveling. So I think it&#8217;s great to have these hybrid events, but for the speakers and attendees, there&#8217;s a big difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />It is. Right now, the designer and developer community are coming together in a virtual and physical hybrid event for Figma, right? Figma has their Config event happening yesterday and today as we&#8217;re recording. They&#8217;ve taken a hybrid model as well. They have a limited number of in-person tickets that sold out, and everybody else can attend virtually, which is pretty cool. I hope to see</p>\n\n\n\n<p>more events do that, take that hybrid approach, limit the number of attendees, but offer the people who couldn&#8217;t attend in person to attend virtually. It seems to be a really good model. The hardest part with that model is the participation of virtual people compared to those in person. I don&#8217;t think anybody&#8217;s really cracked the code on that yet. We&#8217;ll see, though. We&#8217;ll see if somebody figures that one out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I remember there were these little virtual pixel 16-bit hallways during Covid. Some people, you could walk around and I was just like, no, thank you. I&#8217;m a bonafide nerd. I&#8217;m 41, started coding at seven. My first computer was a Phillips, which I learned something insane, that Phillips spawned ASML and so did TMSC. I always associated Phillips with shaving razors, but apparently, they were really good at computers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />They did a great job in the semiconductor industry and other parts of the computer industry. They&#8217;re also huge in medical. They’re kind of everywhere. I worked on a project back in my Adobe days. I was working on a Flex application built for a subsidiary of Siemens called Sorian, called Med Suite. It was an electronic medical record system built entirely in Adobe Flex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />See, I find it interesting that you guys got into programming and the tech ecosystem prior to, let&#8217;s say, Woo or WordPress. Woo and WordPress is actually what got me into the ecosystem. My background was not in tech. I used WordPress early on to manage my website. The reason I learned HTML and then CSS was trying to insert tables on a website. How do I do this? There&#8217;s no WordPress to do a table. How do I do tables? Then, after you learn HTML and CSS, you keep going—PHP, you start to learn JavaScript. Even though I wouldn&#8217;t consider myself a very talented developer at this point, it’s never been my focus. I learned a lot about building and got into different ecosystems, different applications, worked extensively in Shopify, but have worked on e-commerce platform infrastructure as well. Since you&#8217;ve done other things outside the ecosystem prior to working with Woo and Prospress, and I have post working with it, how do you feel like the ecosystem these days compares? It&#8217;s definitely more mature than the early days. As a developer, if you were coming into this ecosystem today, are there things you would expect that you don&#8217;t see?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />I think if I were coming in new right now, the thing that would bother me the most is how to add a table that I can actually use in the block editor to call back your table story. The table block kind of sucks right now. Sorry to those responsible for that block, but at least I filed a bug report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Yeah, now you’re responsible for giving them the feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />It&#8217;s inflexible. There&#8217;s barely anything you can do with it beyond displaying data. Not a lot of options to customize beyond that. The ecosystem is interesting. It is at this inflection point between what it used to be, primarily PHP, and what it&#8217;s becoming, this hybrid of PHP and React, JavaScript, and whatever new technology we want to insert next. The interaction API isn&#8217;t react. It&#8217;s something else. I can&#8217;t remember what the framework is. Is it Alpine JS?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />No, we were saying they should have. We had a conversation with Marcel and Mike when we did our joint. I have a lot of thoughts on the current state because I teach a lot of programming. I wrote an object-oriented programming book for WordPress developers that teaches computer science topics. It’s a huge loss to WordPress that you can&#8217;t do what you went through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s really easy to get started with React, and then 27 steps later, now you can finally write some code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah, exactly. It’s not easy. There&#8217;s a lot of… I think now more than ever, WordPress needs to think about developer experience more if they want to go that route. Before, PHP by itself offered a really good developer experience because you could just literally edit a file, FTP it up. Okay, you&#8217;re cowboy coding, but you could get something done. You could change something and see the effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Well, you could see your white screen of death, but then you got to see your effects later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Then you fixed it, or you could display errors there. It felt more accessible for somebody with no programming background. Now it&#8217;s like, oh, I have to learn react templates. I have to learn this. I have to learn that. But forget about that because does my thing even build right now? I think it&#8217;s a huge loss to the ecosystem. I&#8217;m starting to get to the point where, I mean, things change. Nothing stays the same forever. But I think it&#8217;s more obvious than ever that WordPress, yes, it&#8217;s more mature, but the whole community nature of it is not really the same either. My favorite analogy is that it&#8217;s more like a corporate-backed open source project like MySQL. MySQL is super boring. Nobody knows who works on MySQL. It’s Oracle that must sponsor a lot of developers. WordPress is not quite the same, but it&#8217;s not the kumbaya of open source where people can make contributions. But there needs to be a focus on developer experience, especially in the PHP ecosystem. You&#8217;re competing with JavaScript, which is really popular. Then on the other side, you have something like Laravel that actually does care about developer experience. It’s completely different. If I told somebody to learn something in PHP, now I&#8217;d tell them to try Laravel. They’ll be closer to doing what you wanted to do, which is edit a template file. The syntax is different, but I see HTML tags. I can add some HTML tags. There&#8217;s some stuff there. I don&#8217;t have to compile it. There&#8217;s just so much tooling around it. How do you bring new people in? WordPress used to attract people that never did programming. That’s the best part. That’s what I find the most exciting. I think that&#8217;s what makes the community so diverse. People came from so many different backgrounds, just learned WordPress, and could contribute and build a company like yours. Well, you&#8217;re at your second company now, but SkyVerge was a big company, got bought by GoDaddy, and it started with somebody editing HTML files and adding tables. That&#8217;s amazing. To me, that&#8217;s crazy. So that&#8217;s why I think about that a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Yeah, the diversity one is interesting. I certainly don&#8217;t have a problem at all with a project evolving and becoming more mature. There were parts of WordPress that needed that. If we go back 10 years, the Wild West wasn&#8217;t the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />No, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />We&#8217;ve all seen the good and bad side of that. I think the biggest thing that I see sometimes is if you don&#8217;t have that kind of diversity of thought, you develop pieces of the project in a certain way. I sometimes see that with blocks. Exactly, your point about the table block. One of the things I&#8217;ve seen in WordPress is it was so accessible to me because of how extensible it was. You learn about actions and filters and the hook system, and you&#8217;re empowered to change something without having to completely write your application. Literally with a code snippet, six lines of code, I can change a thing. It gets addictive in a way where now I&#8217;ve changed this thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Then you learn more. Within a couple of years, I was like, I really want to write my own plugin and started writing my own plugins. You progressively learn. I&#8217;m not saying my path is the right one or even a good one, but that extensibility is what got you in. It empowers a lot of people to use the software and made it popular. Sometimes with the block ecosystem, and I&#8217;ve had conversations with the Woo folks about that, who have been very receptive, which is wonderful, without that extensibility or ability to modify things, it makes the project less accessible to those tinkerers. People just trying to build a website for some local business that contracted them and is like, can you do this? It sacrifices some of the interoperability that&#8217;s unique to commerce. If you&#8217;re a publishing site, a block may be the most atomic piece of your workflow. I put a form here, a button there. But from our perspective, working in WooCommerce, that&#8217;s not the smallest piece because another extension needs to modify that too or add something of its own into your form. That&#8217;s been challenging. The diversity of thought of people who have grown up in open source and with that extensibility and playing in the sandbox with everybody else versus in isolation is something I feel is missing in modern day. I don&#8217;t know if you feel the same way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />I do to a point. I&#8217;ve provided feedback on some of the blocks WooCommerce has released, like the cart and checkout blocks. They are these monolithic pieces. They&#8217;re not separated well and weren&#8217;t extensible for a while. It wasn&#8217;t easy to extend them. They finally added the ability to add your own text blocks to the checkout, which was missing. I think the more we think about blocks, the more we have to think about blocks at the atomic level and how they compose into larger patterns. The patterns weren&#8217;t fleshed out when WooCommerce blocks started. I get why the checkout block and the cart block are more these monolithic block components, but now they would be better suited to being a pattern, a composition of numerous blocks that make up all those individual pieces. We would finally get back to some customizability and the ease of customizability on WooCommerce pages. We wouldn&#8217;t be back to the level of code we had the ability to tweak and customize before, but we&#8217;d have a clear delineation between front end and backend development. The visual display being separate from the backend processing makes sense long-term because it gives us</p>\n\n\n\n<p>more flexibility. As it sits right now, we&#8217;re getting there, but we&#8217;re not there yet. I just taught a course for Solid Academy talking about WooCommerce fundamentals with people who haven&#8217;t dove into WooCommerce yet. My favorite thing when teaching WooCommerce is showing people the Business Bloomer visual hook guides for the first time. They have this light bulb moment of, oh, so that&#8217;s what hooks are, that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re supposed to do. That&#8217;s what actions and filters are. Actions interrupt the flow of code, do something, and return control, and filters take an input, modify it, and return it back. Those are the two things we have from a code perspective to change how things work by overriding how they do by default. Just this eye-opening moment for developers where they see those visual hook guides and it clicks. Oh, okay, these are all the things and this is where they live, and this is why overriding that hook or changing its priority does what it does. That&#8217;s the power of where we&#8217;ve been. We have to make sure we don&#8217;t lose that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Yeah, I would agree. With PHP, it’s a little easier versus something more event-based like JavaScript. It&#8217;s easier for a newcomer to grasp. I don&#8217;t lament that we’ve ruined WordPress. It&#8217;s a big step forward. People who have been in Woo as long as we have, we’ve seen some things. There’s the adolescent phases of version 1.6 to 2.0 or 2.3 to 3.0. Those were huge jumps for the project. There&#8217;s a lot of pain to grow up as an ecosystem. I feel like this phase is like that for me, but I’m also back in the ecosystem. It&#8217;s a good change and will make things better. The biggest thing is preserving that superpower of the ecosystem, that interoperability between different code projects merging into one execution stream at runtime. How do you preserve that and welcome different builders into that workstream? I think it&#8217;s a little scary. People are scared because that results in bad things sometimes. But the net positive of the kinds of sites people can create is really cool. Sometimes you have to take the good with the bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />I&#8217;m reminded of the commercials for State Farm. &#8220;We know a thing or two because we&#8217;ve seen a thing or two.&#8221; We&#8217;ve been through the trenches of building WooCommerce sites larger and more complex than imagined. It&#8217;s amazing that open source can do that. It can enable something that even the creators had no clue was a possibility when they were starting out. I don&#8217;t think Mike and James had any idea that something they were working on would power billions of dollars in commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Every year, right? Billions every year. They’ve published the global GMV of WooCommerce sometimes in WooSesh. It’s probably even an underestimate from what I’ve seen. Last time they estimated WooCommerce powers tens of billions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />It&#8217;s hard to get an estimate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Yeah, because there&#8217;s no centralization. I&#8217;ve looked at different ways to estimate, but it’s hard to know how much revenue is online versus offline for some businesses that use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Some people use it internally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />At least tens of billions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I know from indirect clients that they use it just for internal warehousing and internal customers. If you&#8217;re a big company…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Running your own swag store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah, exactly. It could be a swag store or just managing inventory between divisions. In big companies, the financialization is interesting. It’s impossible to track all that usage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />The cool thing is they do that because you can customize it. It has those crazy diverse use cases because of that customization. Your software can work together easily with other software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />It’s the only option. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m still really bullish. Even if Shopify is great, if you want a self-hosted thing, your other option is Magento, and that&#8217;s not really a road most people want to go on. That&#8217;s really exciting. Just from a developer aspect, it&#8217;s not necessarily lamenting, but it comes from being around programming for so long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Yeah, you care about it. You want it to be better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />But also, I love programming. You described it the best way. You can make little changes and feel empowered. It&#8217;s the empowerment. You put a filter, six lines of code, and it did something. And you&#8217;re like, holy crap, I&#8217;ve done something. That’s addictive. How do you get people to that space as fast as possible with as little technical knowledge as possible is really important, even if you&#8217;re not the flavor of the month framework. That&#8217;s the essence. Things can mature and not stay accessible, and that&#8217;s okay. But if you want to think about the health of the ecosystem and bringing new people in, I was really heartened to meet a couple of 23-year-olds at WordCamp EU. I thought we were all late thirties, early forties people. There weren&#8217;t a ton of them, but a few. That&#8217;s really important. It doesn&#8217;t have to be cool, but you want to make it something they&#8217;re not like, okay, boomer. It&#8217;s always going to be like, oh, I want to try the newer thing. It’s good to keep that in mind. The harder it is, the more people don&#8217;t want to do it, and the harder it is to bring people in, which affects health of products, hiring, maintaining talent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />You don&#8217;t want to become COBOL in a few years, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah, exactly. I&#8217;m trying not to say COBOL, but basically not become COBOL. There&#8217;s a big gap between that, but this idea that it&#8217;s good for the ecosystem too, for indirect reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />The accessibility becomes a big thing. It reminds me of what General Assembly did for Rails and how easy it was for people to pick up and start learning. By the end of six weeks, they build a small web app. I hired a lot of Rails developers. Some of our software was Rails with a React front end. As a small company, we didn&#8217;t always hire people that junior, but it was amazing how people could have no code experience but have an interactive web app they built by the end because of how accessible the ecosystem was. Carl, to your point, that&#8217;s a good measure of how well you can thrive and get people in the door. Not people like us who do this all day, every day, and build software for the platform. It&#8217;s people building WordPress websites and need to customize something for a client. Can they do it? If there&#8217;s not a plugin that exists or it only gets them 90% of the way there, have we made it easier for them to get on board and try?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I always try to think empathetically. PHP is my sixth or seventh programming language. I&#8217;m not a representative person, so I always try to think. I think programming is a life-changing career that anybody, regardless of educational background, could get into. Anything that empowers people to do that, to have that opportunity, is huge. WordPress attracted people that never did programming. That&#8217;s the great thing. A lot of people career changed into WordPress, built companies, sold companies, made money, learned even more complicated things. It was great. That&#8217;s always what&#8217;s in the back of my mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />A couple of things based on what was just discussed. We have a newer podcast here at Do the Woo, part of the All Things WordPress and WooCommerce podcast, called The Next Gen, with Allison Dye and Sophia DeRosia talking about WordPress and the next generation of WordPress. It&#8217;s interesting to see what that looks like from their perspective as younger people in this ecosystem. I&#8217;m excited about the next generation of WordPressers. There’s a lot of possibility and potential. I&#8217;m excited about newer community members driving us forward. Also, I got into computers by breaking something. There’s an inherent desire to tinker that comes with being a developer. I was tinkering before I knew what I was doing, and I ended up breaking my grandmother&#8217;s brand-new computer. I ended up on the phone with my friend&#8217;s dad, Tom, who worked at Baxter Labs in their IT department. He was the only person I knew who could help me fix what I had done. I spent hours on the phone with him, and he took his time to help me rebuild the operating system when I was nine or ten years old. That pushed me to understand that tinkering may have a cost, but it also has a benefit. I never stopped tinkering. I encourage anybody interested in development, sitting on the builder side thinking, wow, I really like hearing Zach and Carl talk about development, but it seems daunting to get into it. Just tinker. At the core of what we&#8217;re talking about, the block ecosystem changes tinkering in a way that makes it more difficult. I would encourage people who are newer to WordPress to look at the Roots Project with Radical. It uses the Roots stack and the Roots ecosystem. They have this thing called ACORN that lets you use Laravel inside WordPress. It&#8217;s a completely different way of looking at things than the block editor. It has ways to use and build blocks with an HMR-supported build setup. These are really cool things as part of a nice starting point if you&#8217;re interested in trying something different than what WordPress core does by default. It’s the power of an open-source ecosystem that allows people to build anything because we have all the code. That’s powerful. Sometimes we lose sight of that as a community that&#8217;s been in it. If we were working in a closed-source ecosystem like Shopify, BigCommerce, Squarespace, Wix, or Weebly, we don’t know the internal workings. We have a set of integration points, but that’s the limitation. We can only talk to the things we&#8217;re allowed to. It’s harder to build highly custom things. One of the things I talk about frequently is that Woo</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commerce enables non-traditional stores. We have a ton of capability for selling physical products, but we can also, due to plugins, do things that are significantly different. We can do event ticketing, bookings, hotel reservations. Try that with Shopify out of the box. WooCommerce is highly focused on physical products. It’s not particularly great at virtual products. It can do it, but not particularly well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />You need apps to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yes, you need the booking plugin. Virtual products, event ticketing, time and resource-based booking, accommodation booking, membership sites, online courses, charitable giving, fundraising, peer-to-peer software subscriptions—these are all business models powered by WooCommerce. Think beyond physical products. These are things plugins enable. All these things are possibilities inside the WooCommerce ecosystem. That&#8217;s insane. There’s no other e-commerce platform that can do all those things and do them well. That’s a strength.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />If you were getting into the Woo ecosystem to build things right now, how would you use that information? Would you be building booking plugins? What would you be doing if you were listening to this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />I would shift my definition of e-commerce because what we think of as e-commerce is generally the Amazon model of selling a product and shipping it. Shipping at such a low cost that margins are low. It’s hard to make money without volume when your margins are low. Amazon changed the physical product world. I would change my definition of commerce to be anything that involves transacting through a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Using Woo with a framework to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Exactly. I agree with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />You heard it here, folks. If you&#8217;re a new developer, building the next invoicing app for plumbers is the way to go. I agree. Service businesses and other kinds of businesses—you see them more commonly on Woo because they can&#8217;t use anything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />In addition to that, you have these restricted product categories that don&#8217;t have other choices. These restricted product categories are growing by leaps and bounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Shout out to all the vape stores out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />There are sites I know of in restricted categories doing hundreds of millions of dollars in sales in a month just through WooCommerce. That&#8217;s because we have the capability to build payment gateways and plugins that tie to high-risk payment processors willing to take that business. That’s the open-source nature of WooCommerce and WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Or selling gray market stuff. But one of my favorite WooCommerce sites is a Canadian site to buy magic mushrooms. It’s WooCommerce, and it’s the coolest site. They went all out with a Miami Vice aesthetic. But they can do that. What you can host, what you can sell, what payment options you have is important. So I really like Zach’s idea of expanding, really think about e-commerce literally as electronic commerce. Are you doing commerce online for anything? Like you said, plumber, wedding DJ, book gigs as a wedding DJ and charge for it. Anything. It lets you do that. That’s the real way to think about the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />I favor people I can pay online for things, even a DJ or booking something. If I can do it and pay online, I feel like it usually indicates people are more serious about their business versus someone I have to call and book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Oh, interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />The four to six times a year I book a haircut, I do it online. That&#8217;s how I reserve that person&#8217;s time. I do the same with my doctors, my therapist, and all the other services I consume regularly. All the booking is done virtually now. I’m not calling somebody to set these appointments up. Building these tools increases accessibility to services for people who wouldn&#8217;t want to book them because of the friction involved. Friction is a killer. I know we&#8217;re talking about development, but these things are important to know. Friction is a killer. Statistically, the abandonment rate is 57%. Friction is enough for them after making a purchase decision to cancel, to abandon their decision. They&#8217;ve decided to give you money, and now 55% of shoppers say friction is frustrating enough to quit a purchase. Crazy. Friction can exist in multiple ways. For some people, making a phone call to a location to set up an appointment is terrifying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Don&#8217;t make me call. I&#8217;m extroverted and will talk to anybody at a conference, but don’t make me call for support. I just want to do it online or via form or email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Building these tools increases the accessibility of these services to people who normally would not want to book them because of friction. I think the future of commerce is going beyond the Amazon model. It’s a great model. It works well. But people who look at things more creatively and don’t just copy Amazon will see huge returns. Experimentation will be rewarded in the coming years because e-commerce is growing. The industry segment is growing. It’s already billions more than we thought it would be and will be billions more. I think we’re crossing the trillion-dollar threshold this year in the US for e-commerce transactions. So much money is being transacted online. For anybody thinking, wow, I really want to get into this space, do it. Beka is a testament that you can get into this space, build things people love, and get a call from someone as crazy as GoDaddy, be acquired, build product inside a large organization, then exit and come back in and start again with another plugin company, Kestrel. I can’t wait to see what you, Max, and Justin do with Kestrel. It’ll be a lot of fun to see the future unfold. But we’ll leave that for another podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />You ended with a cliffhanger, Zach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />That’s how we get you back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />We’re talking about having you come back for a product chat in the near future. Be on the lookout for it. Have Beka come back in and talk more about the story behind Kestrel and where Kestrel is going. It’s been a joy talking the history of Woo and some of the thoughts we have around where things are going and development in general. Thank you for joining us this week. Before we wrap up, I always give Carl the opportunity to ask any final questions he has.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I don&#8217;t have any follow-up questions. I’ve just really enjoyed the discussion. I thought it was really good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Carl&#8217;s going to ask when I start building block tooling. Don’t ask me that, Carl.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I wouldn&#8217;t invest in block tooling until they can say, okay, we&#8217;re done. Some people tried to build abstractions around blocks, but it’s so volatile and unstable that it’s not worth the investment to maintain that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Yeah, I&#8217;d agree. You need to work with Woo and WordPress core to make those things happen. The cool news is we&#8217;re seeing it. It’s super exciting to see something change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />There&#8217;s an opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Yeah, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m back, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Maybe there will be an ACF for blocks eventually or something to abstract away and make it easier for people to do these blocks. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />I think ACF block is the ACF block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah, ACF blocks are cool too, but you know what I mean. Something…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yes, absolutely. Something that&#8217;ll be a landmark shift in how we build with the block editor. That&#8217;s definitely something on the horizon. Some tools are really close already. We’re in a good position to usher in a new future together as a community. For those watching some of the drama in this community, remember you have a choice to engage in that drama or ignore it. You have the ability to change this ecosystem by participating. That’s the wonder of open source and contribution. Despite what some people may think or the feelings some may have, we all have the possibility and potential to influence where the future goes. That’s what I remain focused on. No matter how small a voice you have, you have a voice. Use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Beautiful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />Well said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Now that I&#8217;ve ended on a high emotional point, Beka, how do people find you on the internet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beka:<br />I&#8217;m around. I&#8217;d love for people to check us out at kestrelwp.com. As Zach mentioned, we&#8217;ve acquired a number of plugins for Woo to ramp back up. We&#8217;re excited to be back in the space. I&#8217;m on Twitter, B-E-K-A-R-I-C-E. Happy to chat and love to hear what people are building. If you&#8217;re in the Woo space and getting into some new projects, let me know how I can help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Awesome. As always, if you have ideas for what you’d like to hear about on a Woo DevChat, go to your favorite social media platform and use hashtag bug Bob. We&#8217;re still going to make this thing happen. Hashtag bug Bob. Bob will listen to your feedback or just go to Do the Woo.io and contact us there. We want to hear your feedback. If you want to participate in a dev chat, we&#8217;d love to hear your ideas and hear from you directly. On behalf of myself, Carl, Bob, and the entire Do the Woo team, thank you for listening and being part of this amazing community.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to another episode of <strong><em>Woo DevChat</em></strong> and join hosts <strong>Zach Stepe</strong>k and <strong>Carl Alexande</strong>r as they dive into a lively discussion with <strong>Beka Rice, a seasoned WooCommerce expert and product architect at Kestrel.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Beka shares her journey through the evolving WooCommerce ecosystem, the challenges and opportunities in the world of development, and the exciting future ahead with her new venture, Kestrel.

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> As a steward of the WordPress community, one of the big overarching questions that I grapple with is how to make sure people who have just found out about us know how to get around. Obviously, there&#8217;s the contributor path, which is important to me because I am especially concerned with the longevity of our little open source community, but there&#8217;s also a path for folks who are learning how to use the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And so, joining me today to talk through a project called Learning Pathways is Wes Theron. Wes, welcome to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:11] <strong>Wes:</strong> Good day. Thank you very much for having me. It&#8217;s a pleasure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Before we get into this project that we&#8217;re talking about, do you want to just tell me a little bit about who you are and what you do with the WordPress project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:22] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah. So, as you know, my name is Wes Theron. I&#8217;m based in New Zealand, and I&#8217;m an instructional designer. And, I am part of the Training Team. So, most of my life revolves around creating learning content for learn.WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:38] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Oh, that&#8217;s quite a life. Teaching people how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:42] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah, I teach WordPress. We run online workshops. I create video tutorials, courses, and now, of course, this great project we&#8217;re working on, Learning Pathways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:52] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. So, I&#8217;ve talked about Learning Pathways a few times here on the podcast, but for folks who have not heard me talk about it or who just need a more in-depth understanding, why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about this project as it stands today?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:06] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah, so when Learn started out, I think the main goal was to just get learning content on the site. But, in May of last year, we shared an individual learning survey with folks, and we were hoping to basically find out what are the needs of the learners? What are learners after? And from that individual learner survey, we actually learned a few things. We learned that tutorials, courses, and online workshops were the most used content types. We also saw that web-based learning is the most popular learning method. And then there was a clear need for a structured way of consuming learning material. And that&#8217;s basically where the Learning Pathways project was born; to create Learning Pathways that basically target various types of learners, but also various skill levels. So July of last year, we started with outlines, creating outlines for these learner pathways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:10] <strong>Wes:</strong> And then, in October of last year, we actually started creating content. So, the first learner pathways we started working on was the User Learning Pathway and the Developer Learning Pathway. And what that entails is of course, creating a Learning Pathway for beginner users, intermediate users, and then advanced users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s how we kind of broke it up. And last week, the Beginner Developer Pathway was actually published, so that&#8217;s very exciting. And a few weeks before that, the Beginner WordPress User Pathway. And yeah, of course, we&#8217;ve got many other pathways in the pipeline that we want to work on. For example, a Designer Learning Pathway and even a Contributor Learning Pathway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:57] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, when we&#8217;re talking about pathways, what we mean is, like, we are figuring out what you probably need to know when you first arrive and then helping you to identify what you build on based on what your goals might be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Like, obviously, the beginner user, the goal is basically just like, learn how to get WordPress doing stuff at all. Like that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s an easy goal to understand. But when you all were doing the work to figure out what needed to be in the pathway for a beginner developer, and as you&#8217;re looking towards doing the work around intermediate and advanced topics, like how are you all able to determine what most likely you need in those various steps in the learning process?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:42] <strong>Wes:</strong> So, of course, a lot of research went into that. When we created the outlines for these Learning Pathways. We shared it with the community. We asked for feedback. And yeah, a lot of research was done to make sure we cover all the all the bases. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:59] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I know that there were a couple of different proposals about how to, like do skills assessments, maybe? There was something where like we were talking with companies that employ WordPress folks in the ecosystem, and then we were talking to WordPressers who were currently trying to make sure that their skills were advanced enough to get those jobs. And we were trying to figure out like the distance between those and where we actually have some concerns around like the language choices that they need, like basic developer language choices and jargon that goes in there and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So this, if I recall correctly, the research for this has been going on for like maybe two or three years, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:42] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah, definitely. And we&#8217;ve reached out to many stakeholders within the WordPress community. And as you say, even agencies, and businesses, you know, trying to find out what do they want people to know when they employ them. And yeah, then of course, speaking to the community, speaking, speaking to folks at WordCamps reaching out to folks an online workshops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] <strong>Wes:</strong> So, yeah, it&#8217;s definitely been an ongoing process and also seeing what resources are lacking and what needs to be there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, so, the very first, the very first iteration of any training that the WordPress project was offering on, I think it was on learn.WordPress.org, but I don&#8217;t actually know for sure, was a troubleshooting workshop, because when you are trying to figure out WordPress for the first time, when you are trying to figure out any software for the first time, being able to figure out what went wrong is a really important part of that. And so that was like the only workshop that existed over there for quite some time. And so it&#8217;s really nice to see how we have really, not only created a bunch of resources in general, if you all have not looked at learn.WordPress.org lately, it has, like, workshop outlines that you can use to do a training by yourself at your meetup group or at a school or whatever it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But then also, I want to say it was maybe two, three years ago, that you all, as a team, the Training Team, started doing these online workshops. And so, when you created the Learning Pathways, considering like how much time and research has gone into this project overall, did you all have learnings that came from those workshops that you had already done? Is this like a collection of workshops or is this something where you can do it at home and learn by yourself and then go someplace else and learn more about WordPress? Like how does that function in what we have already?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:45] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah, so maybe I should first, maybe let&#8217;s define a learning pathway. So I, I thought about this, but a learning pathway, I would say, is a route taken by learner through a range of modules, lessons, and even courses to build knowledge progressively. So it&#8217;s similar to a course, but of course usually covers like a specific topic or subject where learning pathways usually have a larger goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:11] <strong>Wes:</strong> So I wouldn&#8217;t say that the online workshops form part of the Learning Pathways project. And maybe I can also clarify that the teacher notes or the lesson plans that you refer to is something that&#8217;s also changing going forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Oh, good. Because I wrote some of those, and I am not an instructional designer. And so, ha!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:30] <strong>Wes:</strong> We&#8217;ve actually decided to move away from having two different content types. So, we had tutorials. You know, video tutorials, and we had lesson plans, and as you said, the lesson plans were notes that somebody could use to run an online workshop or to go to a WordCamp or at their local meetup and use that to teach something. But moving forward for Learning Pathways, we are actually just going to have one content type, namely lessons. And then lessons from part of creating a course or lessons from part of creating modules and then Learning Pathways. The other exciting thing, and something we haven&#8217;t mentioned, is that at the end of this month, when we launched the Learning Pathways or the first few Learning Pathways, it actually coincides with a website redesign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:18] <strong>Wes:</strong> So, yeah, beyond the lookout, hopefully, learn.WordPress.org is going to have a brand new face at the end, from the end of July or, yeah, or August. So, yeah, that&#8217;s very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Excellent. Excellent. So, you said that these Learning Pathways are part of a larger goal. Is that a goal for your learners or a goal for WordPress? A goal for the team?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:40] <strong>Wes:</strong> I would say all of the above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:42] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Goals for everybody. We&#8217;re like the Oprah of goals. Don&#8217;t come get me, Oprah. That&#8217;s all I got to say about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:48] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yeah, I think for us as a team, at the end of the day, we want folks to be able to use the content and find the content and utilize all the learning material on learn.WordPress.org. And then, of course, at the end of the day, for learners, we want folks to be able to succeed in whatever they are trying to do. Is it to build their own website? Is it to maybe find a job as a developer? And. Yeah, I mean, the list can go on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. So, on the subject of wanting to help people succeed, I think that as far as I hear from the majority of contributors that I have worked with over the years, like helping other people figure out how to do this and making sure that they can succeed is always something that is top of mind for contributors to open source probably in general, but definitely to WordPress. Like, we really care about helping other people figure out how to have the same sort of benefits that we&#8217;ve had in the project and with the software. So if you have somebody who is familiar with all the bits and pieces of WordPress and really, really want to like show up and help teach some things. Is it the case that they can take part in like running a Learning Pathway? Is it something where we mostly need people to help us build some content? Like if we&#8217;ve got people who are just desperate to help other people succeed in WordPress, what kinds of things can they show up and help do on this project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:22] <strong>Wes:</strong> Yes, please come to the Training Team. There are many ways to get involved. If you just want to review content, you can do that. But yeah, we do have a need for content creators, folks, you know, creating a video lesson or putting their hand up and saying, I will actually create an entire module or an entire learning, a Learning Pathway. We do have some awesome contributors that&#8217;s part of the Training Team that are already doing that. Some people are writing scripts. Some folks are actually, you know, creating everything from the beginning to the end. So they are writing the script, they recording the video, publishing the video, et cetera. And then we&#8217;ve, of course, have people reviewing content. We&#8217;ve got folks running online workshops. If maybe creating video content is not their, is not their forte, they can can run online workshops. So yeah, many ways getting involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:16] <strong>Wes:</strong> But Josepha, I wanted to point something else out that I haven&#8217;t done. I think there was a real need for Learning Pathways because, at the moment, if somebody new to WordPress or new to developing with WordPress wants to find learning content. You know, where do they go? What&#8217;s the main platform to go to? I think most people probably go to YouTube, right?&nbsp;But a lot of the content there are, are scattered and fragmented. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a lot of learning material or learning about WordPress is all over the place. It&#8217;s not in one place. And as I said, a place where you can actually learn from A to Z, learn progressively learning in a structured way. Yes, we know there are courses available that you can pay for, but the awesome thing about this project is that we are providing these Learning Pathways, these learning resources, for free for folks to be able to work through at their own time. I know that&#8217;s something else you asked earlier on. So yes, this is a course in quotation marks; this is a Learning Pathway that somebody can start whenever it suits them, you know, in the comfort of their own home, and they can work through the Learning Pathway from the beginning to the end. Or, if they feel I actually know everything taught in module one and two, I&#8217;m going to start at module three, they can do that. They basically come in at their skill level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:43] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes. I think it&#8217;s really important to try to meet people where they are. And I know that it&#8217;s difficult because, like, we don&#8217;t take a lot of data from our users. You don&#8217;t have to give us basically anything in order to use WordPress. And by basically, I mean you literally don&#8217;t have to give us anything to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And so we always have some difficulty in figuring out what is it that our users need the most in order to succeed the quickest. And so I agree that there was a real need for this not only because, like, there&#8217;s plenty of content for getting from, like, some knowledge to a good amount of knowledge. There&#8217;s almost no content around, like, I didn&#8217;t know CMSs existed until yesterday, and now I need to quickly learn how to do it because it&#8217;s become a thing I need to do in my job. There&#8217;s some really clear, like use cases for being able to onboard quickly and progressively.<br /><br />And I understand that, like, having a clear, structured way to learn doesn&#8217;t always fit with the idea of meeting people where they are. But I do really think that, that like what you were saying, it can be as structured as you need it to be. But also, if you get into it and you think to yourself, you know, I know this information already. I can move on to the next module. I can move on to the module after that. Similar to the way we do that at WordCamps also. If you get into a session and you thought it was going to be useful for you, and you discover that it&#8217;s not once you&#8217;re there, you don&#8217;t have to stay. You can go to a different room where they&#8217;re teaching about SEO if it turns out that you don&#8217;t need to learn about JavaScript today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And I think that that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s kind of the value that this is hoping to bring, like, because it is a little bit built one on top of the other when you discover that you have already learned something, you can easily try out the next step and know that it&#8217;s probably a good next step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:38] <strong>Wes:</strong> Exactly. And if you maybe want to teach this to other folks. The plan is to, you know, we had lesson plans. We have a lot of lesson plans on Learn. But the plan is also to, instead of having, as I said, two different content types, is to have lessons but then add a tab where you can click on teacher notes and actually teach something as well if that is your goal. But yes, our lessons and modules also include quizzes and, hopefully, some practical activities. We&#8217;ve incorporated WordPress Playground where, where folks can actually, you know, test out what they&#8217;ve learned or test their knowledge. So yeah, I agree with you that you can basically join the Learning Pathway wherever you feel the most comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So we&#8217;ve been kind of in the weeds of the project itself, the program itself, and if you want to like do stuff with that and in that. Let&#8217;s switch gears a little bit and talk about just what people who are wanting to join those pathways would need to know. Do you have any advice for somebody who is just today learning about these Learning Pathways and they think to themselves, I definitely want to sign up for one of those. Like, for one, how do they get started? And for two, your like top two or three bits of advice for as they get started? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:05] <strong>Wes:</strong> So you can make your way to learn.WordPress.org, and you can basically open the, the pathway, and you can start wherever, wherever you want to. We have made it possible to actually view these pathways or our content without logging in with your dot org profile. The other thing I also wanted to mention is that our content is actually hosted on YouTube now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the great thing is we have these pathways within YouTube as well. So, folks can go to the, YouTube channel and see our content. And, of course, that basically reaches a very wide audience. And hopefully some of those videos will also bring people to the dot org site so that they can access the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:57] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I think it&#8217;s great that you don&#8217;t have to sign up for a profile. If you are a brand new WordPresser and ran into this in your dashboard and are listening to this podcast now. So dot org profiles are a place where you can kind of log your activity in the WordPress community and the WordPress project. You do not have to have one in order to use WordPress. You don&#8217;t have to have one in order to look at these courses or to learn from them. But I always think that it&#8217;s kind of nice to get your profile set up so that people kind of know who you are and what you&#8217;re doing. And then also your activity shows up. Like, you can see that you enrolled in the course and you get to know for yourself that you made some progress. I know that when you&#8217;re getting started, it&#8217;s hard to, like, see your progress because you don&#8217;t know how far you have to go. And so, like progress when you&#8217;re starting out is really difficult to feel is real. And so I like it just so that you have a few reminders to yourself, like, look how far I&#8217;ve come as you&#8217;re trying to figure out how far you still have to go. And so I like that a lot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:58] <strong>Wes:</strong> You won&#8217;t be able to access all the content on Learn without your dot org profile. But one of the things we&#8217;ve made possible is to access these Learning Pathways, the new ones being launched without, you know, removing those blockers. So, of course, when you work through a Learning Pathway, you will be able to track your progress, and you will be able to see which lessons you have completed. So yeah, one of the pieces of advice I would give to somebody starting with the Learning Pathways actually to first go through the modules. And go through the lessons to see which things you know and feel comfortable with so that you don&#8217;t waste time maybe going through the first module and say, oh, I know this, and you&#8217;ve wasted time. Rather do a bit of research, a bit of reading, and then find the right place for you to start the journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:45] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That&#8217;s excellent. I also, just as a learner, I try to always learn some stuff. And also, as you get older, it&#8217;s harder and harder to learn things partially because like you&#8217;re in a set path, but also, and here&#8217;s my advice to new learners: you worry about looking foolish. Like you, you worry, you&#8217;re showing up, and you don&#8217;t know anything about anybody else in the classroom. And so there&#8217;s this feeling of like, what if I&#8217;m the only person who does not know how to make this work? What if I&#8217;m the only person who can&#8217;t figure out what Wes meant by &#8220;Playground&#8221; or whatever it is? There&#8217;s this real feeling of looking silly when you&#8217;re doing something like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:25] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I can&#8217;t control what anybody else says or does to anyone else, unfortunately. But what I can say is that I think that there&#8217;s never a bad time to start something you wish you had done, right? Like, the best time to have learned how to use your CMS, your website, make your website work was probably a year ago or something, but the second best time is today. And so, like, why not go ahead and get started and be part of that small group of adults that are learning new things every single day? I think that&#8217;s great. And so that&#8217;s my tip is to just embrace looking silly sometimes because you&#8217;re making some choices about your future, and that&#8217;s always a good choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:04] <strong>Wes:</strong> And I would also say test your knowledge. So you&#8217;ve mentioned WordPress Playground. And as I said, we&#8217;ve incorporated into the Learning Pathways, but sometimes you watch a video, or you read something, and you feel like, oh yeah, I know this, but you know, the proof is in the pudding. So go and test it out. Use a test website or use WordPress Playground and test yourself to see if you can actually implement this or do something. So yeah, that&#8217;s definitely one of the other tips I want to highlight; you know, they also say you, you learn by doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:38] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. And also, like if you have gotten to a point you&#8217;ve done the learning, you&#8217;ve done some practicing, you think you&#8217;ve got it and want to like try to figure out what other things can be done with it. I recommend this is how I did a lot of my early WordPress learning to organize an event with your local meetup.<br /><br />Like, I did not know enough about WordPress when I started organizing WordPress meetups. I literally knew nothing. And I basically brought people in and was like, hey, we need people to teach us about this, us being half me. Come in and teach us. And, and that can be a really good thing, partially because, like, you get to know your local folks and see what&#8217;s going on and get a sense for, like, what is out there, especially if you&#8217;re learning this in order to run a business or to accomplish something for your job that you already have, like knowing what&#8217;s out there is super helpful. But then I find that once you embrace the fact that sometimes you will look silly, and that&#8217;s the only way that we can know we&#8217;re learning something. Like once you&#8217;ve embraced it, having some people who are willing to look a little silly with you is kind of, kind of fun, kind of nice. Also, like we&#8217;re all going to look at this problem that we definitely don&#8217;t understand and hopefully look like, at the end, we know what we&#8217;re doing, but between looking at it the first time and at the end of this meetup, we&#8217;re all going to look a little bit silly, ask silly questions. And I think that that&#8217;s a really helpful thing, too. But yeah, knowing some basic information is a great place to start before you do that, especially if you get anxious about looking silly. And I think these pathways are going to really help to get folks a little bit of a leg up on those big questions that they have as you&#8217;re starting to learn how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So we talked about, like, tips and tricks for learners in general. But if you had something that you wanted to share with us that, like, you&#8217;re really excited about for either the Training Team or for the Learning Pathways in general, I think the Learning Pathways are slated to be shipped by, like, end of September or something. So, like, a lot of them are coming quite quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:38] <strong>Wes:</strong> So I am most excited about the website redesign and the new look and feel of the website. And also, you know, one of the goals for us as a Training Team is for learn.WordPress.org to be one of the places people come to and learn about WordPress. And I feel these Learning Pathways and the new website redesign and all the hard work that&#8217;s gone into this project is hopefully going to, make that happen. As I said, our content is also available on YouTube. So we&#8217;ve really tried to make it easy for folks to find our content and also now to digest our content in a progressive and in a structured way. Because, you know, learning is hard. And hopefully, these Learning Pathways have made it easier for folks to, as you said, to build on your knowledge. You know, a lot of times, there&#8217;s knowledge gaps. And I think that&#8217;s what makes learning so hard. And hopefully with these pathways, you can build that knowledge one step at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:44] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. And as is the way with open source, like we can only make these pieces of content better if you all show up and help us like try it out, learn some stuff, and tell us what was confusing. Tell us what was too big a step. Cause yeah, you&#8217;re right. There are some knowledge gaps and when you&#8217;re on the other side of knowing something, it is so hard to tell how big a step is, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:11] <strong>Wes:</strong> Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And so we need y&#8217;all to come in here and tell us very plainly as a new learner like that was eventually what I needed, but this part here was especially confusing. This part over here was too like too many little steps like we just we&#8217;re trying to make sure that it works for you WordPressers, future WordPressers of the world. And so yeah, come build some learning with us over here on the Training Team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:35] <strong>Wes:</strong> And yes, please, we want feedback because, as you say, as we iterate, we want to improve. So there will be a place where you can provide feedback, and at the end of the pathway where there will also be a satisfaction survey for folks to to complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:50] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Great. Well, folks, we&#8217;re gonna have a bunch of links in the show notes. There&#8217;s so much stuff out here to learn with and about WordPress. Wes, thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:01] <strong>Wes:</strong> Thank you for having me. And I will see you all on Learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:05] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings us now to our small list of big things. Although I have to say we have a bunch of links that we&#8217;re going to share in the show notes. If you&#8217;re listening to this in a place where there are not show notes, you can head over to WordPress.org/news. That&#8217;s where we keep all of those. If you are lucky, we also will help you find it on Twitter/X, but I think that it&#8217;s hard to find things over there these days. So WordPress.org/news is your best bet. Now, it is time for the small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, first up on my list is that WordPress 6.5.5 is now available. It&#8217;s got a few fixes in it, some maintenance things and some security fixes as well. I recommend that you update your sites immediately. You can download it from WordPress.org/download, or you can just visit your WordPress dashboard. If you&#8217;re on a managed host, they may have already done this for you, too. But auto-updates, manual updates, CLI updates. However, you want to get it done, get it done. But it is recommended to do this as soon as possible. 6.5.5.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The second thing on my list is that the WordPress Contributor Mentorship program has a call for interest out. This is a program that we launched about a year ago as well. And we had such a good bit of success at the end of the first round in February that there was significant interest in doing another cohort. So, that program connects seasoned WordPress contribution experts with folks who are new to contributing and offer a fantastic opportunity for mentees to gain hands-on experience contributing to WordPress while their mentors share their expertise and improve their leadership skills. So, most of the time, what you are going to be contributing to is probably a release of WordPress, but there are also a lot of opportunities to contribute to things like the Training Team that we&#8217;ve been talking about today and other teams as well. Not everything is focused all around our release cycle. We have things happening in the WordPress project literally all the time. It is a project that never sleeps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Speaking of projects that never sleep, our next official release, our second release of the year, is coming out. WordPress 6.6 is coming out just about a week from now. It is the second major release of 2024 and has a lot of things in it that you will want to check out. If you have not yet seen the hallway hangout where we take a look at what was happening in the release, what we intended to get into the release, take a look at it. And if you haven&#8217;t tested it yet, if you are one of our plugin developers, if you are building something on top of WordPress core, now is the time to check that out and test it against your products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing is that it&#8217;s a new month, my friends. Here we are in July, and we have a ton of things happening in the project. That&#8217;s the theme of my small list of big things: the project that never sleeps. But we have a lot of team meetings that are happening. If you haven&#8217;t attended one in a while or even if you have never attended one of these meetings and you were trying to figure out when to start, now is as good a time as any. You can join your fellow community members and contribute to the WordPress project. And there are ways that you can do that from home and from your computer and for some parts of the project, like from your phone, if you are taking photos out and about and submitting those. So check out make.WordPress.org/meetings. It&#8217;ll give you a sense for everything that&#8217;s happening. Do not get overwhelmed by that calendar. You can just choose which team you think is most interesting to you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:45] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Your small list of never-sleeping things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser. Or, if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at WPBriefing@WordPress.org. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:15] (Music outro)</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 Jul 2024 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Brett McSherry\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"Do The Woo Community: Reflections on the First WordPress State of the Word in NYC 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=5150\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://dothewoo.io/reflections-on-the-first-wordpress-state-of-the-word-in-nyc-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19806:\"<p>Now I&#8217;m not talking about the State of the Word&#8217;s that we hear from Matt at WordCamps.

At the same time it was nearing the end of the year and it&#8217;s not the best time to approach companies about sponsorships. In fact, when your goal is to get things solidified within a week, that is another thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But thanks to four incredible sponsors, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Post Status</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/en-ph/pro/hub-dashboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>GoDaddy Pro</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudways.com/en/woocommerce-hosting.php?utm_source=dothewoo&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=sotwwoo&utm_id=sotw\"><strong>Cloudways</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://mindsize.com\"><strong>Mindsize</strong></a> who stepped up to the plate, the Do the Woo adventure is happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So please visit their sites, or give them a shout out on Twitter. Because when it comes to WordPress, and yes, WooCommerce, it&#8217;s all about community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-do-the-woo-is-talking-about-the-state-of-the-word\">Why Do the Woo is Talking About the State of the Word</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>published December 10, 2021</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the next week or so, the content here on Do the Woo will be primarily focused on the large WordPress community and the upcoming State of the Word.&nbsp; Likely WooCommerce will poke up here and there, but you will notice an obvious wider perspective on all of the content during this time through Dec. 18th.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Woo and WordPress, It&#8217;s All Good</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first obvious reason is apparently the fact that I have created this trip/event around State of the Word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the second reason should also be obvious and it&#8217;s something I talk about a lot here. It&#8217;s the simple fact that WooCommerce sits on top of WordPress. Right? Just about everything that happens with WordPress affects WooCommerce builders in one way or another, ultimately affecting the end user or client.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, as I have said time and time again, if you build with Woo, you must keep on top of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">And There&#8217;s the Community</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been hanging in the WordPress community for 15 years. During that time I have met incredible people and yes, started doing the Woo. With a history like mine, it&#8217;s easy to build event around the bigger ecosystem. Now I will admit that this is not a WordCamp I am going to and I won&#8217;t see as many people as I would have. But the times are weird and we are all doing what we can. But it will be able to share this experience with those online as well as those I get to see in person, both on the way to the State of the Word and during it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community will also hear reflections of Matt Mullenwegs talk from community members and myself on the return home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, I do the WordPress and I Do the Woo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-eat-and-run-with-chicago-wordpress-peeps-on-the-way-to-state-of-the-word\">An Eat and Run with Chicago WordPress Peeps on the Way to State of the Word</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>published December 13, 2021</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Best laid plans of mice and men</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you listen to this podcast (link coming soon), you will hear the story of how <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpmike\"><strong>Mike Demo</strong></a> from <a href=\"https://www.codeable.io\"><strong>Codeable</strong></a> made his plans to jump on the train (not literally) for the leg from St. Paul to Chicago. This transpired into a dinner for some Chicago WordPress peeps. Long story short, plans where made at the Hard Rock Cafe in downtown Chicago and invites were sent out.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_0521.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5486\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Then if you listen to this <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/serendipity-a-chat-with-susan-ramsey/\"><strong>podcast</strong></a>, you will hear how I ended up running into Susan Ramsey, longtime WordPresser and friend, from Fort Worth, Texas. Yes, and she joined the dinner.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chicago WordPress Rules</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It was so cool for both Mike and I to have dinner with <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bgardner\">Brian Gardner</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/onehappystudio\">Susan Ramsey</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sds52\">Steve Stern</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beckyddesign\">Becky Davis</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KKoppenhaver\">Keanan Koppenhaver</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zstepek\">Zach Stepe</a>k </strong>and<strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertJacobi\"> Robert Jacobi</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even from my perspective it was an interesting group relationship-wise. I have known Becky and Brian from way back at Chicago WordCamp, 2011 or thereabouts. Susan has always been on my radar with her past activities in the Genesis community and, of course, my co-hosts of this podcast, Zach and Robert. But it was also very cool to meet two new faces, Steve and Keanan. Because of the limited time and where I was sitting I got to know Steve a bit better, but hoping I will have the chance with Keanan in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trains Will Run Late</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, we learned how trains, especially at this distance, can and will run late. In fact two hours late. As Mike and I had done a podcast on the train and hung out and just chatted, as we grew closer, Mike would frantically check the updates as minutes were slowly being added to the delay. But, hey are we going to let what came as a 2 hour late arrival spoil the party. No way.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_0515.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5488\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Robert Jacobi made he was there to greet everyone. When we got off the train, Mike took off to grab a cab while Susan and I looked for the place that would hold my bags. She was damn good at helping me find the right place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike did make it, gave the cab drive a $20 bill for a $7 fare, and started the party going. We followed and soon were enjoying appetizers and conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Best Part</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, I arrived around 7 and by 8:00 was in the Hard Rock shop grabbing a gift for Judy. Of course I was behind Mike who was stocking up on his Hard Rock findings. As I made my way back to the train station, looking at the photo of the group, I could do nothing but smile, thinking about how much fun everyone seemed to be having, catching up IRL, laughing, telling stories. Seeing each other for the first time in awhile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a joy to see and made me think about this amazing community we have in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So again, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.codeable.io\"><strong>Mike and Codeable</strong></a> for helping bring an amazing highlight to my trip of the #WooTrainClan</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-podcasts-on-the-trip\">The Podcasts on the Trip</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>podcasts published from November 30, 2021 &#8211; December 22, 2021</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ended up doing podcasts before I left, on the train, at the hotel and a few other places. Here are the links to those. One of the train podcasts was completely by luck. So happens a WordPresser I know was on the same train car.

And yes, once again I will be making the trek across country to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is and what was</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You may or may not recall that last year, due to a misunderstanding with flying and ID&#8217;s required, I ended up taking a roundtrip adventure on a train to NYC. In fact I have <strong>several posts here that not only talk about the adventure, but also podcasts that were done along the way as well at in NYC</strong>. I don&#8217;t need to go into the details again, but let&#8217;s just say I have opted for a flight this time. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time for connection, reflection and optimism</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>So you may be asking why I used the resources to fly six hours one way for a three hour event. Well, first I feel I need to be there to represent Do the Woo. And I am able to do this because of the <strong>support of our Pod Friends</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also is perfect timing for the end of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Connection</strong> &#8211; this goes without saying. Although a small crowd, maximum of 50 people, I always look forward to connecting with my WordPress friends. In fact, sometimes smaller is better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reflection</strong> &#8211; when Matt reviews the year, for some it may seem to be only on the surface. But post-state of the word gives me time to think about what he has said. What it means to the community. And what it means for our efforts here at Do the Woo. For me personally, it has more meaning and goes deeper when I experience it in person. Plus it gives me something to think about on the flight home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Optimism</strong> &#8211; I am by nature optimistic. And though there can be skepticism, doubts or even drama for others, each year always brings me optimism in the future of the project.&nbsp; Which lends to the whole experience that I have before, during and after the State of the Word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do admit I am lucky that I can attend. And yes, again I have my sponsors to thank for that. Also, there is a part of me that hopes the SOTW could be worked to be given at all of the flagship WordCamps, as it had been done with WordCampUS before. But knowing that it plays on the end-of-the-year, maybe I am too optimistic there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are one of the few that are able to attend, and we haven&#8217;t talked about meeting up yet, let me know. NYC, here we come!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-state-of-the-word-dinner-with-some-woo\">A State of the Word Dinner with Some Woo</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As you likely know from earlier posts and podcasts, I was able to attend the State of the Word this year in New York City. All because of our Pod Friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When a community comes together</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Since I would be there on the night before the event, <a href=\"https://meetmichelle.online/\"><strong>Michelle Frechette</strong> </a>and I started a conversation with others who were attending. &#8220;How about getting together for dinner?&#8221; Of course, as with any WordPress event, large or small, you will find those interested, both old and new friends. And the fact that the hotel we both were staying at had this very convenient restaurant and bar, well, it was an easy decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Except when you call to make a reservation, get a failed call notice, and learn from the hotel that the restaurant is closed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This led into more conversations with those attended, and those not. Apparently with the size of most restaurants in NYC being small and, to add to that, the holidays, well, finding a reservation for 10-11 people turned into a challenge. The fact that I had left this to only a few days before the dinner didn&#8217;t help.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It takes a community</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We are a hearty group and don&#8217;t give up easy. Along came superhero <a href=\"https://nevharris.com/\"><strong>Nev Harris</strong></a> suggesting he calls the American Express concierge to help and recommend some restaurants was a game saver. And although what we found was an outdoor heated patio, with temperatures in the low 30&#8217;s F, we couldn&#8217;t be picky. Luck was on the side of this WordPress group and we felt we were treated to a semi-private room where good food, drinks and conversation took the stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/51C33347-33A0-4015-A2D4-199FB6D0B253_1_105_c.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5492\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, once you have had a terrific Italian dinner there is no better place to extend the holiday cheer than for a few of us to visit Rockefeller Center.</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/bobwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_1504-1024x768.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5491\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-state-of-the-word-2023\">State of the Word 2023</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings me right back to where we are.

The latter did not tempt me with the heat or the sights. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I spent the day hanging around the hotel/convention center to make life easy. Now the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center is enormous. And I mean freakin&#8217; huge. It kind of reminded me of those large cruise ships, although I have never been on one. It&#8217;s set up quite well. You never really need to leave and everything is overpriced.

Long story short, I took over the booth and used it for the DTW hq at WordCamp US.

But it would be a very long post and, of course, I would have discovered something I missed, or several things, thus even a longer post. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was my second WordCamp Europe, but my first living here in Porto, Portugal. That fact alone, and the love I am getting from the community here, would be worth a post in itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-community\">The Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s never surprising when I hear from anyone talk their experience at a WordCamp, community and people are always in there, often being what they loved most. And for me there is never an exception. New friends. Connecting with old friends. And so much laughter, and yes, food.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Sponsors and the Venue</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The venue was fantastic. Although I must admit at first it was a bit overwhelming as the sponsors winded around different parts and hallways. Some of the small biz sponsors were concerned being off the beaten path, but that changed quickly, at least for the ones I talked to. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fact is I started going around to the booths, meeting people, saying hi to others and stopping for so many hugs and conversations, it took me 3 hours just to do that. On the second day, I spent an hour easily just with the Small Biz sponsors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I talk to a lot of WordPress businesses and I know there are always questions about  sponsoring WordCamps and the value behind it. So I am going t<a href=\"https://barn2.com/blog/wordcamp-europe-sponsorship-story/\">o share a great post from my friend Katie Keith from Barn2 Plugins, where she shares their first experience sponsoring</a>. If you ever had questions about sponsoring, make sure and read it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you missed any of the sessions, or were not able to make it, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@wordcampeurope/streams\">you can find all of them here from the livestream.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, there is a lot more I am still digesting and it will also settle in my brain just in time for WCUS. But I do want to thank the organizing team, the volunteers for their hard work in making it so amazing. And of course, the sponsors who make it possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I leave you with this. Some great WordPress peeps. (and a few taken by others, plus my mug occasionally).</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/bobwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FyZ9OvrXsAM3z1j-1024x683.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"\"

It was an amazing event and even <strong><a href=\"http://https//portobobwptrainer0.wpcomstaging.com\">pushed us to move to Porto</a></strong>, which we are doing end of March.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-then-comes-wcasia\">Then comes WCAsia</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Judy and I were excited that we would be able to attend the <strong><a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023/\">very first WCAsia</a></strong>. Neither of us had been to any part of Asia, so Bangkok was soon to be our first.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/bobwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_1562-1024x768.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1626\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now with all that comes for anyone attending a WordCamp, it can be anything from intimidating, to exciting, or both. I did not know what to expect from this very first flagship event. I knew that it would be good, but I didn’t know I would be blown away.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The event itself</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The event was held on the top floor of what&#8217;s called Iconsiam. A gigantic mall with a conference center.</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/bobwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_1748-1024x768.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1627\" />\n\n\n\n<p>And everything about the organization of the event was top notch. The sponsor area was strategically placed. And I personally experienced a volunteer approaching me a few times and asking how I was doing and if they could help with anything. It was amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor day</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This was my second contributor day. And it did not disappoint. I spent my time with the Community team and we had several very good discussions. Of course a lot of time was put into the day-long event from both organizers and volunteers. And I had to get a shot of all the team table leads from around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1000\" height=\"519\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Contributor-day-leads-WordCamp-Asia-2023.jpg?resize=1000%2C519&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1629\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This was just how big contributor day was.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/WordCamp-Asia-2023-Contributor-Day-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1630\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Two days of WordCamp Asia</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The minute I walked in that morning and headed straight for the expo area, this is what I saw. It was one of the most busy WordCamps I had ever been to, at least from this perspective. And the vibe in the air is what I believe energized everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/bobwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_1595-1024x768.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1628\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The community, the people</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no single word to describe all the new and old friends that I met with. There were hugs, fist bumps, handshakes, and a lot of conversation. I had the chance to meet people who had literally been reading or listening to my stuff for over a decade. It was incredible humbling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I don&#8217;t have these tagged, here is are bunch of selfies and other pics that were taken by others and myself. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Three things really stood out to me</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, this was likely the best WordCamp I have been to. If asked, I would have to say that there are three words that come to mind if I was to describe it as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The energy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I have never been to a WordCamp that had as much energy as I experienced here. I’m sure it was a combination of it finally happening for the Asian community (the first time it was cancelled due to covid), the pride they felt and the fact that so many of the attendees were experiencing their very first WordCamp of any size.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone seemed hungry for community and education. Even the sponsors who frequent many WordCamps, the teams they brought were energized and kept very busy. There was a vibe of this energy with everyone you met.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that both my brand BobWP and Do the Woo is very popular in that part of the world. But until you are able to talk, shake hands or hug, you just don’t know. I met strangers and people who I have been connected with online for a decade or more. I was in what felt like hundreds of selfies with friends and new friends. The energy there was contagious and even by day two, it did not let up till closer to the end of the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The graciousness</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is probably the most powerful word that stuck with us during our entire stay, both at the event and beyond. We felt welcomed wherever we went. The kindness and consideration of each individual we had contact with and I had contact with at the event, was something that added to the energy I previously talked about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Culturally, between the greeting with a bow and hands held together, and those who held their hands over their hearts as they approached you, other parts of the world could learn from those warm and loving gestures and how they made us feel each and every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The empathy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Empathy has always been a huge part of my life, and I wish more people would naturally feel it in all circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned previously, a lot of the attendees where first time WordCampers. Because of the nature of our business, many are introverts and that first event experience can be overwhelming. But it was different. There was a natural born vibe of empathy coming from everyone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vendors talking to community members. People meeting each other for the first time. Questions asked and answered. I would often catch pieces of conversation near me, and more times than not there was a tone of empathy. A tone that said we are the community and here to help each other, no matter who you are, what skill level you have or where you come from. The glass was half full, if not brimming over.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Of course all the other stuff</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There was so much to the event, but at the same time the entire experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Having a little fun and a good laugh</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is nothing better than a good laugh. You may or may not know <strong><a href=\"https://wpbuilds.com/\">Nathan Wrigley from WPBuilds</a></strong>. A great friend of mine and a treasure to the WordPress community. Unfortunately Nathan could not make it, so our friend <strong><a href=\"https://wsform.com/\">Mark Westguard from WS Form</a></strong> created a &#8220;Nathan head&#8221;. And it started popping around here and there at WCAsia. Make sure and click on the images so you can easily find &#8220;Where&#8217;s Nathan?&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nom nom</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The food was incredible. I’m not a foodie as much as many who travel, but the tastes I experienced are really beyond words. I am still deciding my favorites between Thai, Indian and Japanese.&nbsp;Unfortunately, I am terrible when it comes to taking pictures of our food. In fact, I likely got more from the food served on our flights than at the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was this amazing Espresso Martini that we had, in some kind of a chalice at a restaurant in a local marketplace. </p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/bobwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/69856627392__9179F4B0-106B-43AC-A12F-D6A40A1FDD91-768x1024.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1678\" />\n\n\n\n<p>And the best experience I had was a cup of Spicy Coconut Soup with Scallops at a restaurant in the Iconsiam. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t think to take a picture until I was half-finished. Trust me, the untouched presentation was pretty impressive. The taste, out of this world.</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/bobwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_1757-768x1024.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1679\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bangkok</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there was the host city. As mentioned, this was the first time Judy and I have been in Asia. The city was interesting and amazing at the same time. The weather was another thing. We spent an extra three days and found we could spend very little time outside because of the heat and humidity. Average days temp while while there were around 94<strong>°F</strong>&nbsp;/ 34<strong>°C</strong>. We thought we would either melt away or simple pass out. But between the hotel, a boat ride down the river and a few other places, I do have a few shots to share with you. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have I left out?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Likely a lot. But still recovering from jet lag and a good chunk of this post was written on the flight back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we connected at WCAsia, you are now a big part of one of my favorites memories since using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you were an organizer, volunteer or sponsor this year, a big thanks and hug for one amazing event. You should be proud of what you did and the community that you brought together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until WordCamp Europe&#8230;.</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/bobwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_1760-1024x768.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1714\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 07 Jul 2024 12:45:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Do The Woo Community: The State of the Word experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=585\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://dothewoo.io/the-state-of-the-word-experience/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5731:\"<p>I have purposely chosen to not revisit the actual message delivered at State of the Word.

In fact, I have listed a few posts at the end here that will give you that overview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I arrived in New York City late Tuesday evening. The SOTW was not beginning till noonish on Thursday. But I was pretty sure Wednesday would be my &#8220;hang out with friends and community day&#8221;. Of course I was not disappointed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-community-is-where-community-goes\">Community is where community goes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mid-morning on Wednesday, I ran into<strong> Michelle Frechette and her friend Julia</strong> in the hotel lobby. Hungry and in need of caffeine, I joined them for a bit of time at Starbucks. Returning to the hotel, we ran into Rich Tabor, and set a time to find a restaurant and have lunch. The four of us ended up at an Italian place, which would be the first of two that day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came a break before I met <strong>Robert Jacobi, Rich Tabor</strong> at Nancy&#8217;s Whiskey Bar across the street. Where eventually we were joined by <strong>Robbie Adair and Bud Kraus</strong>. Although we didn&#8217;t get a group shot then, Robert did grab a shot of Rich and myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Rich-Tabor-and-BobWP.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&ssl=1\" alt=\"Rich Tabor and BobWP\" class=\"wp-image-586\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" />Thanks to Robert Jacobi for the photo\n\n\n\n<p>After that came dinner. <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/a-state-of-the-word-dinner-with-some-woo/\">I shared a bit of that experience on my podcast over on Do the Woo</a>, which in a nutshell ended up being a fantastic Do the Woo dinnner in a heated patio at yet another Italian restaurant.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_0063-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Do the Woo Dinner in New York City\" class=\"wp-image-587\" /><em>Do the Woo Dinner at State of the Word 2023 with Michelle Frechette, Allie Nimmons, Bud Kraus, Nev Harris, Aaron Campbell, Rich Tabor, Timothy Jacobs, BobWP, Robbie Adair, Julie and Ryan Marks.&nbsp;</em>\n\n\n\n<p>Following that feast, a few of us ended up at the Rockefeller Center.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"800\" height=\"764\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/WordPress-people-at-Rockefeller-Centeer.jpg?resize=800%2C764&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-588\" />Michelle, Nev, Ryan, Julia, Robbie and BobWP\n\n\n\n<p>And that was the day of true community.

From a casual get together at a cafe beforehand, to the event itself and rounding that off with a small dinner with Robert Jacobi, Robbie Adair and Nev Harris.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entire day, day two, filled with community. Old and new friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conversations at SOTW</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I cannot possibly share with you the conversations I had at the event, primarily because I had too many and cannot recall each one. But a couple of instances stick in my mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, I met<strong> Zandy Ring, COO at Tumblr</strong>. This was not only a fun conversation but also very timely as I dive into the Tumblr world as BobWP. It&#8217;s been an interesting platform to sort out. And the insights that Zandy shared with me confirmed I was doing the right thing by taking my time and finding my groove there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, I had a chance to chat with <strong>Matt Mullenweg</strong> a couple of times. The best thing about the SOTW event if Matt is in his element there. The smaller crowd gives it a much more relaxed feeling and I sense that he is truly enjoying himself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the cool thing. There would never be the opportunity where I would be able to share with him the new stuff we are doing over at Do the Woo in the new year. But this event gave me that chance. And even better, he loved what we were going to be doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now with both of these conversations, I was fortunately to be given the opportunity to have them. But I did for two simple reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community is incredible, no matter who you meet</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am extremely fortunate to have such amazing sponsors for Do the Woo that made it possible for me to represent DTW at the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learn more about the State of the Word</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt&#8217;s SOTW was great and there was some really cool stuff he shared.

In today&#8217;s episode we will talk in detail about Create Block Theme Plugin, WordPress 6.6, Gutenberg 18.7, and updates from the training team too. Maybe not in that order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and a full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open-Source Project sponsored by Automattic’s Five for the Future Program. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m delighted to have again as co-host, my dear friend, Nadia Maya Ardiani from Indonesia, member of the WordPress training team, translating Learn WordPress content. And in her day job, Maya creates content for the Hostinger blog and social media. So glad you can make it this time, Maya. How are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Hi, Birgit. It&#8217;s very nice to be back here. How are you by the way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m good. So glad we&#8217;re doing this. And it&#8217;s summer in Munich.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> It&#8217;s always summer here in Indonesia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, I definitely have to visit sooner or later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yes, please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Rather sooner than later because time runs out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah. The last time you invited me, I think it was around WordCamp. After I came back from WordCamp US and you were not attending it. And this time it&#8217;s the other way around. You&#8217;re attending WordCamp Europe and I&#8217;m not, and I&#8217;m getting so FOMO of everything. So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. FOMO is something that I&#8217;m looking at for now. Also for WordCamp Canada. There are some great speakers on there. But I am really looking forward. Are you coming to WordCamp Asia in the Philippines next year? You don&#8217;t know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah, I plan to. I plan to. So hopefully, we can meet again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I hope so too, in-person. Well, did you know that the call for speakers is out for WordCamp Asia?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Oh, not yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> I haven&#8217;t checked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So dear listeners, if you want to come to WordCamp Asia and be on the speaker roster, now is the time to get your creative juices going on what you want to talk about. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I forget again, because I did the last time, I want to mention our new music for the intro and the outro. So this is the second episode actually with new music dear listeners, and I hope you like it. A 100 episodes is a great run for Homer Gaines’ music that we started out with and we used for 100 episodes. But I&#8217;m also grateful that he allowed me to use his music for free. So big prompts to Homer Gaines. And I&#8217;ll share again the link to his music channel on Spotify or what was the other one? SoundCloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> SoundCloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes. Yeah, thank you. The new jingle, or what you call it, whatever you call it, is actually created by Udio, and that&#8217;s an audio AI site. Which I just was trying out. And the prompt was Jango Edwards style intro music, and it&#8217;s called Manouche Morning. I share the link also in the show notes, so you can go to the site and try out your music tastes. But let me know what you think about it, dear listeners. And also, of course, Maya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah, I really like it, because it sounds like something that you can hear from a gramophone and take you back to another time. And it&#8217;s really a nice change of vibe. Because before we have this cool guy, a cool person, who is more very chill and very calm person, and this time it&#8217;s more happy-go-lucky. So yeah, I think it&#8217;s really great. And it&#8217;s like Morning Spirit, like the name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> You kind of get in a different mindset there. And I learned in between that music actually changes, depending on which music of course, your brainwaves. So your alpha waves and your mood. I find it really interesting. So I read more about it. Well good. So that&#8217;s music. Well, either comment on the episode or send me an email or just ping me on Twitter what you think about the music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So last episode, we talked about the upcoming events and now those events have taken place, and I can share the recordings in the show notes. If you are a theme developer, but you are not so much into code and want to use the Site Editor to create your theme, the Hallway Hangout where Beatrice Fialo demonstrated how she changes a theme and then used to create Block Theme Plugin to save all the changes that are normally in the database to the theme files and then make those theme files part of Version Control and GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that process she demonstrated very closely. And on the recap post, I actually also spelled out the steps so you can really follow along. It was really a cool event. And you can actually design a theme and Site Editor and still update the theme files and handle it in Version Control. That was one of the big questions we had on the Outreach channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani: </em>Yeah. I personally also really love Playground because it really helps for content creation as well. Because I don&#8217;t have to keep on tweaking my WordPress site, even though that&#8217;s a special site for testing. But it&#8217;s very handy to have it. I can just test everything there and then forget about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> I don&#8217;t have to reset everything. So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Yeah. You don&#8217;t mess up the site that you use for other things. Yeah. Totally get it. And so I use local or used to use local, and I have probably 25 sites in there. Because I spin up a new site for everything. But that also clogs up my computer, although I have a terabyte of hard drive. But it still clogs up my computer. Because every single site has all the WordPress files, and with Playground I have nothing stored there except what I wanted to store in the browser or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah. The other event was the exploration of Grid Layouts. It was also a Hallway Hangout. And Isabel Brison, also a regular co-host here on our show, gave a great demonstration on how to handle blocks with Grid Layout or the other way around, how to work with a Grid Block, which is a subset of the Group Block. And she showed off the 6.6 features, but also what she&#8217;s working on for 6.7 in an experiment. So that&#8217;s also something, if you are keen to learn more about Grid Layout and what you can do with it, definitely watch that recording.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah. People already starting to work on 6.7. It&#8217;s like, wow, so fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So once decided when the Beta 1 is of major release, then it was also decided which Gutenberg Plugin version will make it from the new feature point of view. So the week the Beta 1 is released, that&#8217;s the week where the Gutenberg Plugin released, and that&#8217;s the last release with new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Beta 1 was on June 4th and the release candidate for 18.5 was already out. So those features made it into the major 6.6. And everything else afterwards, 18.6 and 18.7hat we&#8217;re going to talk to now, are either bug fixes and they will be ported to the release on WordPress but all the new features that add UI, that are enhancement to existing things, stay in the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Isabel Brison, and I think Robert Anderson, they were working on the Grid Layout, they actually started that experiment way earlier, but they were not ready to make it public. So if you want to test out what she showed off in the Hallway Hangout, you need to enable that experiment on the experiment page in Gutenberg before you can actually see that feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s multiple levels of how you learn about new things. And if you want to get in early, the experiment page on the Gutenberg Plugin gives you a clue what people are actually working on. Some of them are pushed forward like the data views or the Grid Layout, and some of them are a little bit stale because there hasn&#8217;t been enough feedback to move forward with a lot of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going back to the announcements or to the upcoming events, there&#8217;s also in the show notes a link to the recording of the developer hours, what&#8217;s new for theme developers in WordPress 6.6, where Nick Diego and Justin Tadlock were talking about all the good things that are coming, especially the overrides to sync patterns and also grid, but also most prominently the section styles, that&#8217;s it, block styles, and how that works with the reduced specificities for custom CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can override. Well, how you can override some custom styles and block style. It&#8217;s a little bit highly technical, and if you&#8217;re not into that, the last part might be a little bit too technical, but it&#8217;s definitely worth checking out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there&#8217;s a set of upcoming events in July on Monday, you might not have listened to that, next week, July 8th there&#8217;s a Hallway Hangout where Justin Tadlock and Nick Diego are talking about the section styles and block style variations, want to discuss with the extenders what are the challenges and what are the problems or questions. Bring them all to the Hallway Hangout. That&#8217;s on July 8th, 1600 UTC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then on July 9th, there&#8217;s a Developer Hour, Editor, Unification and Extensibility in WordPress 6.6. That&#8217;s with Ryan Welcher and Nick Diego. And they talk about how the slot fields and all the other extensibility works now for post editor, site editor, template editor. They&#8217;re all now one interface or almost, in how you can take advantage of it. And the additional ways to add your own interfaces to the sidebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then July 23rd at 1500 UTC is another Developer Hours, and that covers that topic, do you really need a Custom Block? And it explores the alternative, and it was one of the things that early on, but more and more you have already built in ways to modify core blocks without having to create your own blocks. So be based on the core blocks. And with pattern overrides, there&#8217;s another feature there where you can say, okay, maybe I don&#8217;t need my Custom Block. And the other part is the Block Bindings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for custom fields, that you don&#8217;t need a block for each custom field, your customer needs. So you could actually use the Block Bindings for that and bind those information or the values to certain core blocks. It&#8217;s not available for all the blocks, but it&#8217;s 6.6. Block Bindings came with 6.5 and all extended, especially the editing part in the interface for 6.6. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Training Team</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah. And speaking of events, so currently the training team is, we are trying to test GatherPress. So it&#8217;s like an event management application and it&#8217;s open source. So we are thinking, why not? We&#8217;re trying to move through this platform, we are looking for a tool that can help us to improve the flow management of our Learn WordPress online workshops, for the scheduling stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we hope that by testing it, we can try to meet the diverse needs of even organizers and members of the WordPress community in general. And it&#8217;s not just training team members who can test it. Everyone basically can test it. And I will put the invitation to test it in the show notes. And the main areas that we follow will be including its ease of use and then the registering process, and then the editing attendance feature, and basically any other stuff that stands out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s great. Thank you so much for bringing that to the show. I totally dig it. And I remember having conversations about replacing Meetup as the tool for the local Meetups with multi-site, for all the 700 local Meetups when I was a Meetup organizer in &#8217;16 and &#8217;17, so this is great that it comes together now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, the GatherPress Plugin is also now available in WordPress Plugin Repo, so you can also test it on one of your other sites. You don&#8217;t have to use it for WordPress events. But yeah, I&#8217;m going to look at the invite. So that is really cool. When I look at the plugin page, it has blocks for everything and it has for RSVP, add to calendar, the online event, event date, menu and all that. So this is really great. And maybe could even be used for other events, not just WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah. And I myself haven&#8217;t tested as well, so sharing this also became a reminder for me to test it. Because it&#8217;s really great to have this alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Absolutely. Oh, and speaking of the training team, there are three courses that came out in the last couple of months. One is the beginner WordPress user. So if you start out as a WordPress content creator and/or site owner, this is definitely a course to go through because it explains some of the WordPressy things that are a little bit harder to know. It&#8217;s like your driver&#8217;s license course for WordPress. Sometimes we just need a refresher as well. And I just realized that there&#8217;s also an Immediate WordPress User course out there. So I think it just went online. And for those who are….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s very new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Have you worked on those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani: </em>Actually, these three stuff like Beginner WordPress User and then Beginner WordPress Developer, and then Intermediate WordPress Developer. WordPress user, sorry, they&#8217;re all part of the Learning Pathway Project. So lately we try to create learning pathway. Because sometimes people get into learn.wordpress.org and became like, oh my God, there&#8217;s so much stuff to learn. Where do I start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re thinking maybe it will help if we can have separate learning pathways, for example, for people who don&#8217;t have enough technical background, they can start by the Beginner WordPress User. As you already said, it&#8217;s like the driving license for WordPress. It&#8217;s a really nice way to put it. It&#8217;s when you want to really learn from the basics. And then we have Beginner WordPress Developer. It&#8217;s for those who want to start developing for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we have Intermediate WordPress User. So it&#8217;s for people who already have basic fundamental knowledge and then they want to level up their use of WordPress. Maybe for content creation, they want to make it more effective, and then they want to explore the advanced features. So this is what everyone can learn from this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. No, really, and I know there&#8217;s a lot of work that goes into that, especially because WordPress changes so much in the recent year. What I also like is that the single lessons are actually available separately. You don&#8217;t have to go through the course or finish one lesson to go to the next. You can just look at the list of the course and then pick the lessons where you want to expand your knowledge. Or when you say, okay, I need to dive deeper in that topic, and hopefully the lesson covers that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a really good way also for people who actually build sites for others, to say, okay, if you want to learn that, why don&#8217;t you go to that lesson, instead of having to do that training themselves. Although it builds trust, sometimes it can be a bandwidth. You don&#8217;t have the bandwidth as a freelance developer or as a small agency to do all the training. And having an official site where you can point people to for certain explanations or for certain tools, on how to use them, is definitely a feature also very well-built for agencies that are out there and working with clients. You are pretty much the first line of support. So that definitely gives you support in supporting. I like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Support in supporting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So check out the <a href=\"http://learn.wordpress.org\">learn.wordpress.org</a> site and the three courses we will have in the show notes for you. And of course, yeah, the Beginner WordPress Developer course covers all the things that you might need to at least get started. Because there&#8217;s a lot of tutorials out there that assume a certain knowledge of certain things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know because I work with the writers on the developer blog on the WordPress Developer Blog, and some of it is kind of how can we get to the meat of that particular tutorial without having to explain about everything WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani: </em>Everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So now we can point to the WordPress Developer lessons and say, okay, here you can beef up thinking about this or this and that. So it&#8217;s great fundamental work that the training team is doing there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah. And we try to facilitate the many ways people might prefer to learn. Some people prefer to learn audio/visually, some people prefer to just read it, because they can do it anytime and anywhere, and also for the accessibility reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent. Yeah, definitely. That was the section about the training team. Well done on the training team and everybody else out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; Create Block Theme Plugin<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us to the section, what&#8217;s released. And before we dive into WordPress 6.6 some more, I just wanted to give a shout-out to the latest release of the Create Block Theme Plugin. It has become my most favorite plugin that I actually use. And the team working on has released version 2.3 with a few more capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now you can add image credits to the theme modal. So there&#8217;s a theme modal where you can put all the information about a theme that you create in there. And there&#8217;s now also a section for the image credits if you use somebody else&#8217;s images in there that are not commonly licensed or public domain. So you can add this to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>External links are now translatable. So the translation team, whoever and polyglots wants to translate a theme can do that. There is a new About section in the editor that helps you with what the various pieces are about. And the landing page in the plugin has been majorly improved from the design, and it now looks a little bit more like that plugin is. And then now the font settings. When you clone a theme, the font settings actually persist over the cloning part. So what the original theme is doing you can do. The clone theme is also respecting that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there were quite a few bug fixes and all that. But it&#8217;s so great how this plugin actually evolves throughout the times and goes along with the WordPress features. I think that they&#8217;re working now on some pattern management, but they need to wait for the core to finish developing. Sometimes the heart of the matter, if you want to create, you can create patterns in the interface, but you need to export them separately and not with the theme. So that&#8217;s kind of a major stepping stone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the styles and section styles, they haven&#8217;t implemented that yet. But it&#8217;s coming along and stay tuned.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress 6.6</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So for WordPress 6.6, release candidate two is now available for testing. Today, we are recording this on July 4th, thinking July 4th to our American listeners. Happy Independence Day. Hope you have a wonderful weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And enjoy the summer coming in. But no rest for the wicked. WordPress 6.6 is scheduled to come out July 16th. That&#8217;s 12 days away. And there is with the release candidate one, also the Source of Truth came out, a compendium, it&#8217;s a book about that, WordPress 6.6. Compiled or composed, edited, authored by and&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Curated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Curated By Anne McCarthy. It&#8217;s all you want to ever learn about 6.6 in any detail, about every feature. It might not interest everyone. But you can actually&#8230; She tags each feature for the intended user, like this is the theme author, plugin author, end user or enterprise level or for everybody. So you can actually use the browser, find function for the tag theme author, and then go just hop from one occurrence to the next and read it that way. That&#8217;s how I do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> If you need a shorter version, Jamie Marsland summarized the most important feature in this video and calls it WordPress 6.6, huge changes coming soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> As a content writer, I am so thankful that Anne McCarthy always creates this source of truth every time there&#8217;s a major release. So it became our source of truth, literally, to write anything about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s also interesting that today&#8217;s marketing team, from the make teams shifting to Media Corps. Because it&#8217;s expanding the possibilities for the Source of Truth. Now that we are going to have that one place, one central to getting everything about WordPress and being updated on it. So it&#8217;ll be really helpful for content creators especially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, it&#8217;s actually meant for content creators. It&#8217;s not so much for end-users, because that also can be quite technical. So Jamie Marsland, in his video, points out pattern overrides, the grid layout, and we all talked about the negative margins, the custom shadows, and as well as the data views.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there were actually for the developers additional def notes since the last episode were published, and one was the updates to the interactivity API, miscellaneous editor changes. These are smaller changes, but still don&#8217;t overlook them. A definite about section and styles, is definite about the CSS specificity. That&#8217;s a very difficult word for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Me, too. It&#8217;s a tongue-twister.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And it reflects how hard it is to talk about that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah, yeah. 6.6 specificity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Specificity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> So many S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And then there&#8217;s a roster of the design tools per block that&#8217;s just a table of lists, all the blocks, and then which design tool, line, typography, color, dimensions, background image, gradient, yay, duotone, which block does what. And then there&#8217;s another dev notes about the theme JSON version three that also covers the style variations or the section style variations, how you can manage them through theme JSON.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maya, from all the small and big features, what intrigues you as a content creator the most?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> I actually want to say the zoom out view, but sadly, based on the 6.6 Source of Truth, it&#8217;ll be available on a future release. But I was like, if it&#8217;s finally available, it&#8217;ll be a game changer, because I can&#8230; Instead of cut and then move it to somewhere else by scrolling up or down my mouse and put it on the wrong part of the website, being able to zoom it out will be, oh my God, it will be&#8230; What is it in English? Sorry. It&#8217;ll be really time-saving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yes, absolutely. Yeah. I can definitely see that. Because we are so focused on the block or on the section kind of thing that sometimes you need a full view of a page. And the zoom out view is&#8230; We are looking at things sometimes only for the block section and what&#8217;s in front of us, but the zoom out view gives you actually a view of the full page and how everything fits together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s very important when you look at template previews or on pattern previews or even on when you go through the categories of patterns and then you see the pattern, how would that fit in into your full page kind of thing? Yeah. But if I understood it correctly, it wasn&#8217;t all that seamless to use. It was always a little bit of a surprise when it happened that the team still wanted to&#8230; And nothing is hated more than a surprise by an end user. What did I do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Did I do something wrong?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. That&#8217;s the first question I always ask. What did I do? And how did that happen? So they wanted to finesse that a little bit more and make that usage a bit more intuitive. So apart from what&#8217;s not in 6.6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> What else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> I think it&#8217;s the unified editor experience. It just makes sense to me to have the featured image position way higher than before, because before it&#8217;s down there. Now it&#8217;s way up there. Because when we create a blog post after finishing the text, the first thing that comes to mind is what feature image we will put there to represent the blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because having a proper and featured image is also important for the SEO and for branding, especially if we name the featured image with the keyword that we target, it&#8217;ll boost the SEO performance as well. And I like how the publish flow looks more compact and less distracting. Because some stuff gets inside when we click something and&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The three-dot menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yes. It can be also less intimidating for newbies because there&#8217;s not so much stuff right there. And then I&#8217;m also interested in the pattern overrides, because it will be so handy and time-saving. And also help create a cohesive design across the site, especially for no-code or no designer, non-designer users, and then also the negative margins because it unlocks the design possibilities for us who don&#8217;t really design in our daily lives. So yeah, it will look really cool, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, absolutely. And I like the combination between the grid block and the custom shadows. And then now you can have some overlap of images and text, and you don&#8217;t have to use a cover block to have that because it&#8217;s hard to organize that. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani: </em>It&#8217;ll be so fun to play with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. Great tools in there for designers that are no-coders. Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of cool. Yeah. I&#8217;m a total fan of the pattern enhancement that comes with 6.6. It&#8217;s not only the set pattern overrides that were punted from 6.5, I like the additional time, which really helped with the feature to bring it in. Because now you see it in the sidebar which content you can override and how they&#8217;re called.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to create this, you can actually guide your users, which piece of the pattern you can override. So there&#8217;s a sidebar on that, when the pattern comes in you really see it. And there&#8217;s also the full pattern management, is made available for sites that use a classic theme. So they get a menu item in the WP admin and also all the pattern management screens. So that&#8217;s a big deal for the classic themes because they still dominate the space of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everybody changes themes every two years, but users can take advantage of the broader template part and pattern management. And theme developers can also make those available for their users. So I&#8217;m really happy about that. Yeah, we talked about the grid layouts. I&#8217;m absolutely a fan of that. And because you can have so much more design, although I want to do something like a Pied Mondrian kind of style, and I am….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Looking forward to doing that. And now you can also create your own drop shadows and you don&#8217;t need a theme developer or a developer for it or wait for core. You can create your own drop shadows with the color, how they lean, what&#8217;s the angle and what&#8217;s the distance from the thing. It&#8217;s not available for all blocks. But I think it&#8217;s still only for four blocks, but it&#8217;s definitely changed for the content creators to make some interesting things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani: </em>Yep, yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And one thing I really like is that it&#8217;s finally coming to WordPress, and that is, to use….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani: </em>What is that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The tab button to indent list items?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani</em>: Yeah, I forget about that too. It&#8217;ll be really nice too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And because it trips me up every time I know I&#8217;m going to use it very much. I have not learned to work around it. Why can&#8217;t I do this? So I try it every time I use a list that needs to have multiple hierarchies. So I&#8217;m really happy about that. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Finally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>The time that I don&#8217;t spend in WordPress, I spend in Google Docs. So some things from Google Docs. What drives me crazy in Google Docs is that I can&#8217;t just highlight something and put a link underneath with copy paste. That kind of trips me up in Google. And I was like, Google, get on with it. And GitHub can do it, WordPress can do it, you can do it too. And this was the other way around. Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of what Google does nicely and WordPress does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked a little bit on the podcast already about the new screens coming, called the data views. And those are the admin screens, that insight editor to manage pattern pages, styles, navigation and templates. And as they are tested for more admin redesigns to come. And yeah, I&#8217;m really excited about that because it kind of gives you a little view into the future, and also lets you already use it and see how that works well for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know for 6.7, they&#8217;re looking at making those available for the media library and also for the post because those two things on the content side, they still use the old WP admin for various reasons. Most of it because of the extensibility that needs to be built in, because a lot of plugins kind of tap into these screens right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the 6.7 is probably going to have at least some first versions of that in that. If you&#8217;re a plugin developer, you might want to check out theWordPress&nbsp; component package data views. And there&#8217;s also one that contributors are working on, it&#8217;s called data forms, maybe to make them work for your plugins or at least test them out, and what it would bring for you later on in a year or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then of course, the last feature that I am really happy about is the extensions of the Block Bindings, they were a big deal in 6.5, but the enhancements that coming in 6.6 is even more useful for site owners and site content creators, because WordPress now offers various ways where you can update the custom fields through the Block Binding screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the meta boxes that are on bottom of your screen are not the best interface. They also don&#8217;t have any validation and all that, but you can now change it right in the block. So if you have a typo of inner value for the meta, thinking of a book, if you have a typo in the author. Or you can change the author right there in the block, as well as if that&#8217;s in the archive, you can use those Block Bindings also in the archive pages through your templates, but users can then change, oh, this is a wrong date, or this is a wrong location. They can change it right there in the archive pages in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s kind of nice to have that now built into the Block Editor, what before you actually needed custom blocks for it or you needed ACF for it or parts or something like that. But now you can just have the custom fields connected with blocks still in the early stages of course, but it&#8217;s not complicated fields or complicated connections. But it&#8217;s a start and it might make….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani: </em>We&#8217;re getting there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s getting there. And it might make quite a set of custom blocks redundant if you could use those for that. And you don&#8217;t have to maintain the code for that. Yeah, that&#8217;s what I think about 6.6. What I like and what&#8230; I am really looking forward to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> It&#8217;s less than two weeks from now, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> 12 days from today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> 12 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So this comes out on Sunday, and you have only 10 days once you listen to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> 10 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Or maybe today, Thursday. Well, it comes out on Sunday, so you only have eight days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 18.7</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But that was not the only thing that was released today or this week. The WordPress 6.6 release candidate two, it was Gutenberg 18.7. Total of 115 PRs were merged in Gutenberg 18.7 with seven first time contributors. Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was going to look at that and hope they contribute not only their first contribution, but also because now they&#8217;ve got the process right that there will be many, many more contributions from those users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Of course, of many contributions after this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right, right. Yeah. And with WordPress 6.6 at our doorstep, many contributions are focused on bug fixes. So there&#8217;s not a whole lot of new features in there, but what we are talking about, some of them are really&#8230; We will find in 6.7, but let&#8217;s talk about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is now a content panel for template parts, and that is good because now developers, and when you create templates in the editor, you can add a description and that shows up in the content area for that template. So you can make your theme a little bit more descriptive. Then the next one is, we talked about the published workflow, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Mm-hmm. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And there is the Sticky Toggle, which is something that means the sticky post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That is&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> It&#8217;s now under&#8230; It will be under&#8230; Wait, I forget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Those three dots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;ll be under the status and visibility. And I think that will be great because it makes it more clear what sticky means, especially for non-English speakers and beginners. Because I remember the first time I learned using WordPress, I was confused what does this sticky mean? Because I was trying to make my first blog post and then I tried this sticky feature and nothing happened. Of course, because my post is only one. So I cannot see what this feature actually does. So by moving it under status and visibility, I think it makes it more intuitive. Because by that we know that, oh, this sticky might be related to the visibility. Oh, it&#8217;ll stick to somewhere in the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I think you&#8217;re right. And it&#8217;s also not the first&#8230; The first few blog posts you probably wouldn&#8217;t need to know about Sticky Post to get that into your feature set that you would need. So why is it there? Yeah, you&#8217;re totally right. Yeah. What they also did in 18.7, why am I still two years, in 16?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani: </em>Numbers are also hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, numbers are hard, especially for writers. But I&#8217;m actually a number person, so&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Ahh. Yeah, yeah. Number person and alphabet person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I used to say, so it&#8217;s a real miracle what word people do with numbers. Because I looked at budgets from word people that didn&#8217;t work out. But off my tangents now. So one feature that comes with 18.7 is the alignment of the naming models. So we are renaming and naming quite a few things. One is we renamed the sections in the pattern overrides. We renamed template parts, we renamed posts and pages, titles, and all these models, they looked a little bit differently every time. So they are now aligned and use the same design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it makes it less of a friction, because every time you see something different, you think there might be something different, but there isn&#8217;t. So that&#8217;s really good for quality of life improvement on that. So we haven&#8217;t talked a lot about the writing mode support for blogs. What is that? That is&#8230; Do you know what that is? Have you ever used it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> I tried it, but not really applied it to my daily process. But I think it opened more design possibilities. Because we can make any other element to be vertical or there are so many possibilities that we can do with the layout and then with the message that we want to share to the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, definitely. Yeah, so you could pretty much say in the fonts you see in the three dot menu in your font, typography, things you see, vertical alignment or orientation, is I think what you see. Font orientation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Oh, yeah, orientation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So you can then say, okay, I want this headline to be vertically aligned with the paragraph that it kind of comes after. So it actually will be on the left-hand side instead of on top of it, but it is vertically aligned. And yeah, as you said, it&#8217;s a nice design tool to break up the wall of text, I call it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you use headers and list items and all that, they need to be visually attractive at one point, so you can end this PR or with 18.7, the feature of the vertical alignment comes to other blocks. The writing mode support is now also available for buttons and verse and side tagline blocks and side title blocks. Not just for headings and paragraphs. There&#8217;s a theme JSON settings in there, and you can also kind of see it then in your style blocks. So I think that&#8217;s a great feature to have, that is added to a few more blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So wonderful. Another tool, it&#8217;s not a tool, but what has changed, and you will see it in 6.6, is that with the entity that you&#8217;re editing. So what do I mean by that? Is it a pattern or is it a block or is it a template? And now you get a document bar on top of the screen that actually tells you where you are. And that document bar is now also available in 18.7 Gutenberg with the style book and the style revisions. So it&#8217;s one more piece of getting the orientation right for a content creator. So what am I actually doing? And I liked it for templates and for pages. So am I in template mode or am I in page editing mode, which is kind of a little different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah, I checked the GitHub issue and still cannot really comprehend what we will get from this feature? But then you just explained about it. It makes me, oh, yeah, yeah, I will&#8230; looking forward to this. That&#8217;s why even though I&#8217;m not really a technical person, I&#8217;m still keeping notes and updating myself of all these updates. Because, oh, this one, I might need this. And just taking notes of everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And the last one, it&#8217;s also a very small thing, but it&#8217;s really improved the quality of life of these new features. And I&#8217;m sad it&#8217;s not going to come to 6.6. Not that I&#8230; Because it&#8217;s the tool top to hover over the color and to typography presets. So if your theme has, or if you&#8217;re a theme developer and you create color and typography presets for your theme, then the user can hover and identify that color palette or what typography, what&#8217;s the font like or what do you call those fonts. And you can then point people to it in your documentation and say, well look at that. Well look at this. And the Tooltip helps you identify really the things that are on screen. All right. Do you want to add something to the Tooltip?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani: </em>Yeah, I just want to say that this will be very handy for working with teams because you don&#8217;t have to pick that one that is the third one from the top. You can just say the name of, what is it? The color presets. The color palette. So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bug Fixes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. No, you&#8217;re right. Yeah, it&#8217;s really hard to organize it. So we mentioned quite a few bug fixes in there. And there is one in there that we are talking about, that&#8217;s the writing flows, split the heading into a default block. You can split a block and then it&#8217;s still going to be a heading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah. Because sometimes when we enter in the middle of the heading and then it creates another H1, let&#8217;s say. It just didn&#8217;t make sense to have&#8230; Why do we want to have two heading one in a row? So yeah, it just makes sense to have when we enter, it automatically becomes a normal text like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, a normal paragraph block. Or when you get carried away with writing a headline and say, ah, no, I want to break it and do that as a subheading. Yeah. Yeah. So that&#8217;s a very good fix. You can also now, it fixes the custom color palette. Because that was always a little bit hard to use when you wanted to create new ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah. I also found this one really useful because sometimes, especially for brands, some brands have that very specific color and by being able to create the custom color palette, it will help us to have a website in our signature color.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Yeah. And this fix actually makes that workflow much smoother and you don&#8217;t have to fiddle around with it too much. And the next one is that for the grid, we talked about the experiment, about the grid interactivity, and it now allows blocks to be positioned in manual mode using drag and drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the handing of grid and grid cells is going to be much easier. And even in the manual mode you can use drag and drop to place your blocks on the grid. There were two things that I want to&#8230; There are quite a few documentation PRs that fix or add to the documentation, which is always appreciated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The interactivity API docs now have an addition of the WP-async directive documented. It&#8217;s for the developers when they go out and grab some data from somewhere and how to push that into the website. And then for the Query Loop Block, it clarifies some explanation about the variation examples that are in core, so developers can handle them. And I think that was it, what we have for Gutenberg&#8217;s 18.7. Yes, we are almost through.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s in Active Development or Discussed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have one section for the&#8230; What&#8217;s in active development or discussed, and I just wanted to let you know that the GitHub repo for the next default theme can&#8217;t….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Twenty Twenty Five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Very good. We did not plan this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And I connected with Carolina Nymark who created the repo, and she just said that it&#8217;s pretty much right now just to put the placeholders in. Because the release team for 6.7 hasn&#8217;t been announced yet. And the default theme Co leads, will be part of the release team. So we need to wait for that. But if you have any input or any ideas for Twenty Twenty Five, you can definitely create issues there and start and raise your hand if you want to contribute however you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> The Twenty Twenty Five will be part of the last release of this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Which is WordPress 6.7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> 6.7. Oh, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes. Yeah, it&#8217;s the next release and it will come out in November. But I think the release date is before Thanksgiving, so it&#8217;s November 12th. So it&#8217;s way before Black Friday and all the holidays are going to start. At least in America, between Thanksgiving and New Year, nobody really, everybody shops and not a whole lot of people work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s time for&#8230; Have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, it&#8217;s time to have fun, but also to keep websites stable so the online shopping spray is not interrupted. And because that&#8217;s where most people make the year&#8217;s revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Gift giving time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s giving time, it&#8217;s buying time. It&#8217;s Black Friday time, it&#8217;s Cyber Monday time. It&#8217;s all the discounts that come around for that. Yes. Yeah. So I&#8217;m so happy that you were on my show, Maya. Or on our show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Me, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And it&#8217;s always wonderful to chat with you about WordPress and all the things content creators do with it. So when people want to connect with you, where would they find you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> So you can find me on wordpress.org, of course. And then I have LinkedIn as well, and Twitter and Instagram. But lately I&#8217;ve been taking social media time off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> So if anyone wants to get in touch with me, I think wordpress.org. And maybe if you want to read anything related to me, so in training team, we recently developed&#8230; We have a new initiative, so it&#8217;s Contributor Spotlight. So we celebrate the journey of training team contributors. It&#8217;s initiated by Courtney Paulo-Kranzke or Courtney PK, we call her. It started this January, I think. And yeah, you can all read it on the training team made WordPress Blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, wonderful, wonderful. I&#8217;m going to put a link in the show notes to that profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, thank you for that initiative. It&#8217;s always good to read the stories, contributor stories. And I will add your LinkedIn and your WordPress Slack profile or WordPress Slack account as well to the show so you can all follow up with Maya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nadia Maya Ardiani:</em> Thank you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> You&#8217;re welcome.

I wanted to pull a bit from that before I bring you to-date.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-my-first-thoughts-on-community-and-noise\">My first thoughts on community and noise</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dated October 20, 2020</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow comes the official launch of this new site. And let me tell you, it’s been an amazing journey of learning and understanding myself as well as the audience I will be speaking to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting aspect of this is the main goal, connecting the Woo builder community. I talked about this on a previous post, but I would like to dive into the concept of connecting. And conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I was asked about  groups for Do the Woo</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What brought the idea of Facebook groups to mind was something that happened as I have been chatting with various people about my new site. When I talk about connections, conversation and community, a few times I was asked,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you creating a Slack Channel? Starting a Facebook group? Perhaps a forum? Where are you growing your community and letting them have a conversation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we go into or lurk in community chats, whether it’s a Facebook group, regular chatter on any social platform or even Slack, often we end up in the middle of a massive amount of noise. There is a lot going on. Conversations going left and right. Sometimes with a bit of anxiety, bitterness, and yes, anger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I’m not saying that nothing good comes out of these conversations. But that isn’t the only way to connect and grow a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can start with this, the art of listening. Remember when that was part of connecting? Taking the time to listen to someone else share their insights and perspectives. Getting a better understanding of that person, and often, the community they are representing. In fact, get three people together for a good conversation and I can guarantee that you will get a lot more out of it vs. endless streams and threads of online chatter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take it a step further, though: personal connection. Learning about someone and then reaching out to them. Or perhaps, even having a connector that will help to introduce you to others in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that’s it. I am the connector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s via a podcast conversation or a post interview, I am connecting you to a new face. Or it might even be me connecting you personally with someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get enough of that noise, or what you might consider chatter amongst dozens of people via social and other platforms. And yes, I enjoy that. But with Do the Woo, I am cutting through that noise while bringing the Woo builder community together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in the end, when I do conversations, they are one-on-one. A Zoom chat. A DM on Slack. Email and a variety of other ways. The point is, again, no matter how or where you do it, listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-now-it-s-today\">Now it&#8217;s today</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So I was hoping as you read that you hung onto the fact that I wrote this over three years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, it has since resonated with me and, to be honest, I think it has always been a part of how I have built my own communities. The fact is we all do it in some way. For Woo builders, while keeping it on the business side of things, it may be a community of customers or clients. It may also be a community within a business you work for, or perhaps, colleagues of yours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also build communities around you brand or business on your site, on social, on Slack, you name it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are community experts out there that will give you advice. There are also social media consultants that will do the same, specifically for social communities. The thing is that one size doesn&#8217;t fit all. And often that is what you will discover over and over when seeking advice on building your own community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been building community long before I got into the WordPress space in 2006. With our other business, there were ways that we built our community, and some of this was long before we did it online. I don&#8217;t proclaim to be an expert on community building, but I can share my own experiences that have worked for me. No promises here that I will deliver the perfect piece of advice for your needs, but I am hoping this will give you a bit of a different perspective on community building and something to ponder on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-community-does-not-need-a-bunch-of-noise\">A community does not need a bunch of noise</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now before I get into this part, understand that this is how it works for me, and in these last few years with Do the Woo, it has proven right for me. And by no means am I saying it&#8217;s the right way, or the only way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just feel that a lot of people never think about other options when building community. They tend to &#8220;jump on the bandwagon&#8221; of <em>engagement</em> and <em>active conversation</em> as the only way to build all communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-engage-or-die\">Engage, or die</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Community and social media experts say you must engage. Or else why do it? Your community will not thrive without this engagement. It often is literally rammed down your throat. At the same time, engagement isn&#8217;t always clearly defined, and seen as this constant need to reply, comment and add your own opinion, advice or simply be part of the conversation, no matter what.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, I have seen social media experts take &#8220;engagement&#8221; to a new and disturbing level. They constantly drop into conversations with replies like &#8220;nice&#8221;, &#8220;that&#8217;s great&#8221;, &#8220;cool&#8221; and &#8220;yeah&#8221;. If that is considered engagement, well, count me out. In fact, shouldn&#8217;t engagement also mean bringing value to a conversation. Not simple, meaningless replies that help you as they build up your metrics in your social media engagements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-everyone-has-an-opinion\">Everyone has an opinion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the beauty of the human race. We all have an opinion and can freely express it. But on the other hand, at times, it&#8217;s nothing but added noise. How often do you see a thread of a conversation and it appears that most of the comments are left by people who never read what others have said. And alarmingly, more people appear to never have read the original comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, it comes across as being all about &#8220;you&#8221;. You and what your opinion. It&#8217;s like a freaking room of people just shouting out what they are thinking, and ignoring everyone else. Nothing gets resolved and more times than not, it can turn sideways and end up being a never-ending debate or argument, instead of a discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now with both engagement and conversations, it&#8217;s not cut and dry. And neither of them are something that you should consider totally dismissing. In fact, depending on the goal of your own community, you may just ignore the advice I have given you so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that all said, I simply bring these up to give you another thought to ponder on as you build your own community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-where-is-this-all-going\">Where is this all going</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This has turned into quite the long post and if you are still with me, I&#8217;m amazed. But hey, it also means you are listening, or perhaps, reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do the Woo now has 14 co-hosts and more coming on board. On top of that I am constantly having people come in and host their own show, more of a one-off opportunity. And who knows what is next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact is that each time you hear a show on Do the Woo, and you don&#8217;t hear me, well, that&#8217;s because I was listening. Behind the scenes, taking notes, and enjoying the conversations. Sure there is what you might consider noise in our community, but it&#8217;s softer, more viable and easy to focus on. There is a time and place for lots of noise in many communities, and that is where it will thrive and stay.  But for now, I&#8217;m in my happy place.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 14:00:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"Do The Woo Community: The Perfect Marriage of Content and Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=5385\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://dothewoo.io/the-perfect-marriage-of-content-and-community/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2303:\"<p>I typically don&#8217;t spend a lot of time in the past, but every once in awhile I become reflective.

Although I had not been traveling as much over the years prior to COVID, still, I found myself reaching out to more people online. More one-to-one conversations. More digital meetups. More forms of smaller online events. But, to be honest, I probably connected more with the community that than I have in any of the previous years in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During that same year I found myself burning out on content creation around blog post tutorials. I have done these for years and I just couldn&#8217;t poke one more out at the keyboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I decided to focus on more community-focused content, such as my podcasts and virtual meetings. It became a natural marriage of content and community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-between-now-and-then\">Between now and then</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So on reflection, this was one of the best moves I have made in my WordPress career. I continued on building the community at Do the Woo. Online connections grew, and then when IRL events started back up, well, they blossomed. That tie between content and commiunity have grown to be such a huge part of Do the Woo, and everything I do these days. And now on to 2024, the biggest year yet for Do the Woo.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 14:00:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"Do The Woo Community: 16 Years Later, the WordPress Origin Story by BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=3325\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://dothewoo.io/16-years-later-my-wordpress-story/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4535:\"<p>As I celebrate my own birthday today, many more than 20, I am reflecting on the years WordPress has been there for me. Oddly, I&#8217;m not sure where to begin except the beginning. And if I was to write a post to publish on the 20th anniversary of WordPress, it&#8217;s gotta be done here on BobWP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, there lies the fact that I just returned from WordCamp Lisboa where I gave a talk on 20 Years of WordPress community. So it&#8217;s a bit on my mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-george-clooney-was-named-people-s-sexiest-man-alive-and-i-discovered-wordpress\">George Clooney was named People’s sexiest man alive and I discovered WordPress </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These two events have nothing more in common than it was the same year, 2016. I can&#8217;t say I think George deserved it, but I had other things on my mind. In fact two things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First this was the year I became a bit intrigued with blogging. Nothing that had me gasping at the thought of writing posts, but simply a curiosity. At the same time I was trying to step into the world of web design as we had been running a marketing and design company for 13 years. And as much as building a site thrilled me, which was equal to having my hand smashed in a door, I figured there had to be a better way than html and flash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time drifted by. Judy had started a blog on Typepad and didn&#8217;t give a crap where it was. She just wanted to write. As I eased into the next year, WordPress slipped into my consciousness more and more. It seemed apparent that this thing called WordPress was going to become part of my life one way or another. Seriously though, I didn&#8217;t have a clue to what extent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the next few years, up to 2010, bit and pieces fell together. I found a theme on a fairly new site called iThemes. The concept of these seemed to be luring me into creating a site for our business that didn&#8217;t look like shit. And that&#8217;s exactly what WordPress and the Corporate theme from iThemes did for me. Without any freaking code!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The BobWP brand rises out of the ruins of ancient web design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I am avoiding going through my 16 years of WordPress history, simply for the reason that I cannot afford to lose you through my years of pivots, twists and turns. It may make you dizzy and I don&#8217;t want you vomiting before I wrap this up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But 2010 was the pivotal moment in my WordPress Story. Why? Well, I had been doing some blogging workshops the two years prior to that year. I was getting my feel for where I need to go with WordPress. I was starting to explore the community more and more from that day in 2006. And I liked what I saw.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the time came to make the transition from our marketing and design firm, Cat&#8217;s Eye Marketing, to something that would let me do my WordPressy thing, whatever that meant and wherever it led.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got rid of all our our &#8220;print&#8221; clients or the last few that we were hanging onto. Mentally I told myself I&#8217;m going all in on WordPress. Design, training and whatever else would come my way. And it was time to rebrand. Not the business, per se, but myself. I was going to be the brand. So after some contemplation, possible consumption of alcohol and severe mumbling to myself, I came up with BobWP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mmmmmmm. It was short and sweet. And the domain was available, go figure. But would people get it? Would someone that doesn&#8217;t know what I do, and doesn&#8217;t know WordPress find it to be puzzling? Would people say my business is Bobwup? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, those concerns and questions did not weigh heavily on me. Nor did the fact that I was tying myself into a personal brand, that, well, would likely die with me. I bought the domain, and made it happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you may know the rest, the rest is history.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I&#8217;m a WordPresser at heart</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I really do love the community. And at this point I&#8217;m here to stay. Right now I&#8217;m doing what motivates me the most. Connecting people. Raising voices. And meetings some of the coolest people I have ever known, both in these last 16 years and moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as much as I find it kind of weird singing Happy Birthday to my dashboard, my computer or any part of the software, or thinking that WordPress could be my grandchild, I will say this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Happy 20th Anniversary, WordPress Community</h2>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 14:00:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"Do The Woo Community: Are We in WordPress Community Version 3.0?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=4975\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://dothewoo.io/are-we-in-wordpress-community-version-3-0/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3740:\"<p>I was recently on <a href=\"https://wpmainline.com/podcast/wp-mainline-episode-19-godaddy-acquires-pagely-doing-the-woo-and-wordpress-contributor-churn/\"><strong>Jeff&#8217;s podcast over at WPMainline</strong></a>. A good part of the conversation was about the GoDaddy acquisition of Pagely. We also chatted about community and how some frustrations have led to great people moving on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with the acquisitions, blocks, community disruption, etc. etc. etc., a thought occurred to me. We focus on the versions of WordPress, but what about community?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-three-versions-ago\">Three Versions Ago</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to think of it this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpress-community-version-1-0\">WordPress Community Version 1.0</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is when it all started. WordPress moved on from being a sparkle in Matt&#8217;s eye to something on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpress-community-version-2-0\">WordPress Community Version 2.0</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure exactly when this came out, but am looking at the 2007 &#8211; 2010 time frame. Why? This is when I started using WordPress. Ha. Well, that isn&#8217;t the reason. This was the time period a lot of the veterans in the space started up businesses. Or entered the space themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But more importantly I think around 2010 WordPress really started to gain traction. Why do I feel this way. From experience and having talked to others, this we a sweet spot. Where the rubber hit the highway. And again, from conversations with others, this seemed to be a ripe time to really dive into the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly, what followed in that time, I can guess that the community started kicking up a few notches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpress-community-version-3-0\">WordPress Community Version 3.0</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This one happened in the last couple of years, or maybe when 5.0 came out for WordPress. This is when the stuff hit the fan. More rapid innovation and more rustling in the community. Acquisitions are on the journey to become a norm. Rumblings were hot and heavy. And the community, well, started feeling different. Depending on who you are and what you perceive, those feelings where either really good, kind of sucky or a mix of everything between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now rest assure, this is something that came to me as I was driving back from the grocery store at 7:30 am while having just listened to Cory from Post Status talk to Josh from Pagely about the acquisition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose I could go on to fill a lot of versions of the community between those versions. That would be fun, but obviously time-consuming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All I know is that I am curious now about version 4.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update/Sidenote:</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had the chance to go on the<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-excerpt-no-41-wordpress-community-versions-past-present-future/\"><strong> Post Status podcast and take a deep-dive with David Bisset on this topic</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here is a poll he took on Twitter with some interesting results and comments as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> folks: based on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobWP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BobWP</a> post here what WP generation do you feel you belong to?<a href=\"https://t.co/bjNynPvjL6\">https://t.co/bjNynPvjL6</a></p>&mdash; David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/1476956055448006656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 31, 2021</a></blockquote>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 14:00:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WPTavern: #126 – Aaron Jorbin on Navigating WordPress Major and Minor Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=156753\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/126-aaron-jorbin-on-navigating-wordpress-major-and-minor-releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44100:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how WordPress gets updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature in the podcast while I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Aaron Jorbin. Aaron has led teams responsible for some of the largest and most prominent WordPress sites in the world, including Rolling Stone, Variety, WIRED, The New Yorker and The White House. He&#8217;s also a WordPress Core committer who focuses on improving developer happiness, and making the internet usable by everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s been an integral part of the WordPress community since 2010, and today Aaron opens up about the crucial importance of major and minor WordPress releases, and the need for user trust, which forms the backbone for features like auto updates that enhanced WordPress security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the process behind WordPress releases, discussing how major and minor releases a planned and executed. Aaron explains the dynamics of the Core Committer community, a group of around a hundred dedicated individuals, about 50 of whom are currently active, whose decisions and hard work keep WordPress robust up to date and secure. The commitment to transparency, minimal egos, and the ability to handle criticism are mentioned as key elements for maintaining trust inside this community within a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about how communication and decision-making take place mostly in public forums, ensuring openness and collaboration. The conversation also touches on the ebb and flow of volunteer and sponsored contributors. The challenges of coordinating across global time zones, and the need for asynchronous decision-making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron explains what it takes to move from a small contributor to a key player in the WordPress ecosystem, emphasizing the burden of responsibility that comes with making changes affecting millions of non-technical users. Whether you&#8217;re a developer tester or enthusiastic user, Aaron encourages contributions in various forms, from sharing ideas to testing and providing feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered how WordPress is maintained and updated, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Aaron Jorbin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Aaron Jorbin. Hello Aaron.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:42] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> Hello Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> This is going to be a really interesting episode, and I confess, dear listener, that this is an episode that I basically know almost nothing about. So everything that comes out of Aaron&#8217;s mouth is going to be schooling me in a process that I know nothing about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it is probably the most important process. Without the process that we&#8217;re going to discuss today, the entire enterprise of WordPress doesn&#8217;t exist, because we&#8217;re going to be talking about the way that WordPress is released, goes from one version to another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get into the meat of the podcast though, Aaron, can I just offer you the opportunity to tell us a little bit about yourself, who you are, where you come from, where you are at the moment, because that&#8217;s kind of interesting, and what your role in the WordPress community is, please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:26] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> So I am Aaron Jorbin. I have been a Core contributor since 2010, and have been involved in WordPress since about a year or two before that. I went to a WordPress meetup and got sucked into the community, got lucky. And it was right before WordCamp Portland 2009, which was sold out in like three hours. And so I had not gotten a ticket, and there was a raffle for tickets. And so I was able to win the raffle and get a ticket, and get to go to a WordCamp, and start meeting the people that I had known from IRC in real life, and got brought in then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my role, I am one of the Core committers, so I&#8217;m one of the one hundred or so people that can make changes to WordPress Core itself. And for the last year, I&#8217;ve been specifically focusing on the minor releases of WordPress, so the maintenance and security releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these are ones that are much smaller in scope, these aren&#8217;t bringing in new features, but in my opinion, some of the more important ones. They&#8217;re the ones that are auto updated by default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the changes that we make in these releases go to every site. And it is a terrifying moment when you start rolling them out, and you just have to cross your fingers that everything is going to go smooth. And so we&#8217;ve put a lot of processes in place to help them go as smooth as they possibly can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That has been my main focus, but I&#8217;ve also worked a lot on the build tools of WordPress, and on the more low down systems. I haven&#8217;t done a lot with many user facing features. I think the last user facing feature that I had a heavy hand in was the ability to log out of other, where you were logged in elsewhere. And we did user testing for that at the final WordCamp San Francisco, so I think that was 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Honestly, what a fascinating story. Can I just ask though, if we go back to 2010, I think that was the year that you said you began your WordPress journey. So it&#8217;s a long time, you&#8217;ve been doing this software now for 14 years. What was the path of escalation that took you from, I&#8217;m brand new to WordPress, to Core Committer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it feels like, if you&#8217;re into the software of WordPress, Core Committer is, that&#8217;s like where the road ends. There&#8217;s not really too many places to go beyond there. You know, you&#8217;ve got the capacity to improve WordPress. You could destroy it if you so wish to. So how did that path happen? And I&#8217;m guessing it was a sort of slow, incremental community journey, but I&#8217;d love to hear that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:07] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> Yeah, so my first code contribution was, so Jen Milo, who was at the time the UX lead of WordPress. She published a blog post about a few small UX changes she would like to see in WordPress Core. And I was like, well, I&#8217;ve got some extra time on my hands. I&#8217;m going to try to work on one of these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I sat down for a couple of days, and worked on the initial patch for it, and went back and forth with Andrew Nacin, who was a new committer at that time, and we came up with a solution. This was during the 3.0 cycle, and it was for the ability for you to see, if you attempted to change the admin email in WordPress, it sends an email that you need to confirm, but there was no notice whatsoever that there was a pending change. So it was just adding a notice that there was a pending change, so you could know that someone had tried to change it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, worked on that, and that got accepted. I was very excited. I ran home to my then girlfriend, and told her, oh my God, oh my God, you&#8217;re not going to understand any of this, because she was not a techie. This is what I did. My code is now going to help power almost 20% of the internet. That also shows how old this was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there it was, well, now I&#8217;ve seen this process, now I&#8217;ve been involved in this process, what can I do to continue being involved in this process? And so I was working on a few small enhancements, or bug fixes, every release. And did that for, probably about three years before I got a job at Condé Nast, the magazine publisher. And part of my role there was to really help the company used WordPress better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that gave me a lot of freedom and time, and I found one of the best uses of that time was to help make WordPress itself better. If it&#8217;s better for Condé Nast, it&#8217;s probably going to be better for everyone. And at the time, one of the challenges, it was right as the Git mirrors were added for WordPress. And I was like, okay well, now we have patches that are coming in through Git, coming in through SVN, coming in against the old Core repo, versus against the modern develop repo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I worked on a tool called Grunt Patch WordPress, that made it easy for you to apply patches from anywhere. And you could just enter a ticket number, it would list all of the patches, and it would apply it automatically, no matter how it had been created. And working on that, I got involved more in the build tools, and was asked during the 4.1 cycle, if I would be willing to become a committer, and if I was willing to help maintain WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was a huge honour, and a huge burden that I would be willing to take on. My friend Daniel Bachhuber gave a talk a number of years ago, my condolences, you are now the maintainer of an open source software project. And in many ways, like you are taking on a great weight. Your changes are going to affect other people, and you are going to be responsible for making these changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is still an honour that the community and other committers trust me enough to stay in this role, and that I have been able to make a number of changes, and hopefully make WordPress better in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It is such an interesting tale that. And really, I think the word that&#8217;s coming out of it for me was one that you just said, and it was trust. It feels like this whole process, from 2010 until the moment you were offered the Core Commiter status, it feels like it&#8217;s a work of building up trust, of doing things in a way which is fully transparent. People can see what you&#8217;re doing. You&#8217;ve done something important. Things worked, I guess, as well. And over time, people just begin to say, oh okay, yeah, Aaron, oh yeah, his name&#8217;s come up a little bit. And then eventually, that moment where you get the ability to alter WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I guess the journey between 2010, okay, it was 20% of the internet. It was still big. But it&#8217;s like going from 20 to 43, let&#8217;s say about there at the moment. That&#8217;s a big jump. To be approaching half of the internet is incredible. And you illustrated, or you alluded to the fact that you sometimes probably feel the burden of that a little bit. You commit something, and millions of people are going to feel the effect of that. And millions of them will be utterly non-technical. And so they will not know when something goes wrong. They will not understand where to go and seek resolution to that, potentially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that must add to the burden even more because, you know, if something goes wrong at my local shop, I just take it back and get another one. If something goes wrong with a website and I&#8217;m non-technical, then, yeah, that&#8217;s really interesting. So trust is what I&#8217;m imagining is the sort of essence of what you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:14] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> Yes. So ultimately, user trust matters. I think it was Andrew Nacin who first said to me that, what makes WordPress work as well as it does, is the trust the users place in the software. The fact that users trust WordPress to auto update. Without auto updates, WordPress would be less secure. Without the ability to have a bug fix, or a security bug fix go out nearly instantaneously, it would be weeks before many people logged into WordPress. Potentially, you know, some people will set up a site, and set it and forget it. And they would get hacked if it wasn&#8217;t for auto updates. And so having that user trust really is a requirement for WordPress to be as successful as it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So there&#8217;s the trust from the community, but also presumably there must be a fairly high level of trust between you Core Commiters. And I think you said about the number 100, something like that. Have I got that right? Is it roughly around there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:17] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> It is about a hundred people that have committed over the course of the 21 years that WordPress has been involved. I think there&#8217;s about 50 active at the moment in some way, shape, or form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But a hundred broadly speaking, over the course of WordPress, and maybe 50 at the moment. I guess the trust between all of you must be fairly high. And I presume you must have back channels. Well, of course you do. But I&#8217;m really just leading you down the garden path of, tell us what these are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you communicate? How do you maintain that trust? Is the trust, dare I ask it, is the trust ever taken away, and somebody has to be removed from that role? So yeah, let&#8217;s just get into that. How do you communicate? How do you ensure that trust is kept going? What are the ways that you build all of that up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:03] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> First off, there&#8217;s very little back channel. There&#8217;s very little that is not discussed in the open, related to WordPress Core. Security is about the only thing that does not get discussed openly. Otherwise, there might be some conversations, especially when things are just not known. When people have, what I would refer to as a very half-baked idea. You might back channel, and have a quick side discussion with one or two other people, to try to make that idea a little bit better, so that you don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re going to embarrass yourself by sharing the idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than that, it is all in public. It is in Slack, it is on Trac tickets , it is on GitHub issues, it is on pull requests. That discussion is happening in public, and is open for anyone to really contribute their thoughts and their ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And where the trust amongst us comes in, is the fact that I think, generally, there is very little ego involved in the people that are committers. We don&#8217;t feel bad if another person tells us our idea was wrong, or our idea isn&#8217;t the right solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is okay for someone to tell me that my code is, bad or that my code doesn&#8217;t solve the problem. That&#8217;s not an insult to me personally. I think that all of the committers, there&#8217;s that idea that we are all going to be okay. We&#8217;re not going to insult each other. It&#8217;s not an instance of, what idiot made that decision? That&#8217;s not the type of thing that would ever be said amongst committers. It&#8217;s, okay, what information was had that guided that decision? How can we improve that information?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Does the Core Commiter community, you mentioned that it was, over time it&#8217;s been a hundred, and at the moment it&#8217;s 50. Does it ebb and flow a little bit? In other words, are there people who just take a step back, maybe come back in six months time or something? Or are many of those people in some way able to commit to Core on a more or less permanent basis because, I don&#8217;t know, maybe they&#8217;re sponsored, or seconded by their company or something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:08] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> Yeah so, I mean, I would say most of the people that are active are given support in some way, shape, or form. So myself, I have GitHub sponsors that, right now, are covering a portion of my life expenses. But others are paid full-time, whether it be by a hosting company, by a product company. And so most of the people that are active are supported, but not all of them. There are a number of committers that are still doing this on a very volunteer basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people&#8217;s activity does ebb and flow. And so, I think a good example of this is myself. So I was very active, especially during the 4.1 to about 4.9 timeframe. But then I took on a different role, and didn&#8217;t have as much time. And so I stepped back from necessarily doing as many active commits, and more was there to help be in meetings, and provide some historical context, or to work on a couple of small things here or there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then after I left my most recent job, I was like, I&#8217;m taking a break. I stopped looking at computer screens for nearly six months. It was incredible. But decided that, ultimately, I like WordPress. I like contributing to what I view as a very important mission to democratise publishing. I think that, even if I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with everything everyone has to say online, I think they have a right to share it and a right to say it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to help people do that. I want to help, whether it be a small business that just wants to get word out about its hours, to a large media company that wants to do journalism, to politicians who I may or may not agree with, wanting to get elected. I think that everyone has a right to share their beliefs online, and WordPress helps unlock that, and I like working on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nice. I think, if we were to poll every single person that&#8217;s used WordPress ever, which should be a difficult thing to do, but let&#8217;s imagine that we could. I&#8217;m imagining that the vast majority of those people would not necessarily have technical expertise or any interest in the project. They&#8217;re just using it, it&#8217;s functional to them. They may not even know that it&#8217;s called WordPress. They log into their website, and they do their thing. They create their content, and they click publish, and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yet It just magically updates itself from time to time, whether that&#8217;s at the click of a button, or something, a little bit more automated. It just sort of happens in the background. And also, I would imagine that the listeners to this podcast, even though it&#8217;s very likely that they&#8217;re really quite crazily into WordPress, there&#8217;ll be this curtain between what they experience, and what Core is doing. How all those decisions are made, and how those changes get pushed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, they may have noticed, obviously, that there are minor releases. So we go from 6.5, to 6.5.1, to 6.5.2, and then there are more major releases, 6.5 to 6.6, or 7 at some point, you know. But the major releases kind of have dates in the calendar, stretching right out into the future. So we try to get those dates for the whole year, and you can look those up online, and may provide that in the show notes. But you can see, in theory, they&#8217;re provided for. We&#8217;ve got a north star. We know that on this date we should be shipping the next version of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in between those major ones, we get these little ones which come around, like today. Little ones just happen, might happen in a week, might be two weeks, there might be a few weeks that go between them. How are those decisions made, and could we break it into the two parts? Could we do the major first, and then the minor afterwards? Because I think the major is more, how to describe it, there&#8217;s more thought goes into it on a long term basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s more north star of that, and the minor ones feel like sometimes it&#8217;s reactive instead of proactive, because of security and so on. So let&#8217;s do the major releases. How is it decided what features go in, what we&#8217;re aiming for, what we want to ship?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:05] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> So, I mean ultimately it&#8217;s decided what is going in by what is ready to go in, for a major release, and what people want to work on. Whether that is individuals that have a improvement that they really want to drive forward, whether it&#8217;s a company that decides that they want to donate, or devote, resources to working on maybe a larger feature that they think that will benefit their users, or hopefully benefit all users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decisions of what is ready to go in is basically a decision of the committers as a whole. And it&#8217;s often based on a consensus. And it&#8217;s not necessarily that everyone agrees, it&#8217;s that no one disagrees. So we will work in Slack, there will often be people that are guiding it. There are individuals that are wholly focused on just looking at the backlog of requests, and every idea that ever has been proposed. And saying like, okay well, this is a common theme, and this is a way to solve that problem. And we&#8217;ll be working towards that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so those major releases will often be set, generally by the project leadership, by Josepha and by Matt. And the dates might flux. Oftentimes we&#8217;re looking at trying to find a date that works for everyone in the world can be hard. There are holidays nearly everywhere, or nearly every day in some countries, and so trying to minimise the impact of those releases. And so not doing a release on a major Christian holiday, or a major Muslim holiday, is generally best possible solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the minor releases, like you said, there&#8217;s kind of the reactive ones, in which case, those would generally be decided sometimes hours ahead of time. In the case of 6.4.1 two weeks ahead of time in other cases. So the recent 6.5.3 there was about one month of process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And basically what it was was, it started with, some discussions in Slack of, okay, I think we&#8217;re going to want a maintenance release. Let&#8217;s try to put together a group of people that can lead it. And then, okay, amongst that group, let&#8217;s discuss possible dates. Let&#8217;s look at calendars. Let&#8217;s look at our personal calendars to make sure that we will be available. Let&#8217;s look at the holiday calendars to make sure that we&#8217;re not scheduling it during a bank holiday, or a religious holiday. And let&#8217;s try to do our best to make sure that people will be available for that release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as what goes into the minor releases, it&#8217;s a lot of times like what bugs are known, what bugs are people reporting, what things can we fix in that timeframe? And so, a way that people can get involved is, there will generally be a post on Make Core about the release, and if you don&#8217;t see one, there&#8217;s always the weekly Dev Chat agendas, where you can comment on there. And commenting about a bug of, I think that this bug needs to be fixed in this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We keep the scope rather tight, and that we try to focus the bug fixes solely on recently introduced bugs, rather than longer standing bugs, but anything can be discussed. If someone wants to try to make the case for it, they can try to make the case for it. The idea that, in the presence of new rationale, a good maintainer changes their mind often. And so even if the answer is initially no, that doesn&#8217;t mean the answer is no forever, and adding new information, adding data can really change minds a lot of times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You talked about a consensus there, and in fact, I think the implication of what you said was that, broadly speaking, the consensus is often there. There&#8217;s often broad consensus amongst you Core Committers about what needs to go in. In a way that kind of seems surprising, because you&#8217;d imagine that with 50 minds staring at a problem, there&#8217;s going to be 50 different solutions, and a lot of arguing and tussling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, again, I suppose that goes back to the trust thing that we talked about earlier, and maybe something different to trust, maybe it&#8217;s accommodation, or the ability to defer to somebody politely, as opposed to just wanting to railroad them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I feel maybe that in the corporate world, that whole governance model would break down reasonably quickly. Is that what you&#8217;re saying? That the 50 of you, or however many are in the, air quotes, room at the time, you really do have that? There is a consensus of almost everything that goes in. That&#8217;s remarkable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:46] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> I would say we get to consensus. There is not always one to begin with. There is absolutely disagreements that happen, and disagreements that take place. And I would say that there are very few changes that aren&#8217;t without some sort of, often minor, disagreement. Of whether it be, I think this line needs more documentation, or I don&#8217;t like the variable name used here, ultimately nitpicky things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the way up to major, I don&#8217;t think that this is something that should be in Core disagreements. And you will have discussions, and sometimes that discussion will peter out, and not necessarily get to a quick resolution. Oftentimes though it will get to a resolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And another saying that I often use to guide me is, no is temporary, but yes is forever. Saying that code is not ready for WordPress isn&#8217;t saying that this code is never going in WordPress, or this feature is never going in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s very few things I can think of that I would be like, this should never go into WordPress. But once it is in WordPress, it is the responsibility of all maintainers, all of the committers to maintain it, and to make it as best as it possibly can. Once it&#8217;s released from WordPress, because there will be features that are added that might get removed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think the font library is a good example of this. This was originally targeted for, I think, 6.3, and wasn&#8217;t quite ready. And then 6.4, it got very close, but then ultimately was pulled back. And then 6.5, after a lot of disagreement that people probably saw publicly amongst many committers, we did find solutions in a way to ship that, in a way that I think ultimately has been beneficial for the users of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is the release lead for each release, so that, let&#8217;s say, for example, 6.5 or 6.6, has a release lead. Is the release lead ultimately responsible for the go, no go decision? In other words, if the 50 of you are, yeah, you can&#8217;t quite get that consensus that would be lovely, then it falls on the shoulders of an individual, and if you follow the project, you&#8217;ll know that that individual changes from time to time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:05] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> Yeah. So, I mean ultimately it is Matt&#8217;s decision. And I for one, think that Matt has very good product sense, and WordPress is largely successful because of Matt. And I think that there are very few cases where I can think of where a problem has needed to be escalated to Matt to make a decision. Ultimately, you know, it&#8217;s often there will be a decision that gets made amongst the people that are most active, and working on it closely. And it&#8217;s not a highly conflicted situation. It&#8217;s very rare that the release lead needs to decide between two camps, if you will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think sometimes the impression, out in the wider world, probably not in the community of WordPressers who follow the project really, really closely, but I do wonder sometimes if there is an impression that decisions, like any hierarchy, there must be somebody at the top making all these decisions and what have you. So that&#8217;s really nice to hear. That&#8217;s nice to hear that you think that&#8217;s a fair and equitable way of doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I wonder how you feel about the, I can&#8217;t think of a better word, so I&#8217;m going to use the word chaos. The open source nature of the project can at times be fairly chaotic, because everybody gets a voice, everybody can put time into things, everybody can push their own agenda. I guess in a more corporate structure, it would be top down, whereas we&#8217;ve got a much flatter structure in WordPress. Everybody gets their go. Does it sometimes feel a little bit like that? And I&#8217;m not asking you to throw any names out, or throw anybody under a bus. But, does it occasionally feel, oh, can we just make the decision? Can we just do this, or this, which one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:45] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> I think chaos actually is a great term for it because it often is, and especially when working around the clock. There are people contributing in nearly every time zone. And I think you would struggle to find a time of day where someone isn&#8217;t working on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily there&#8217;s very few decisions that need to get made at a snap of a hat. It is almost always a case where the decisions can be made asynchronously, where the discussion can continue possibly over the course of multiple days, or weeks. And the chaos works. And I know that a lot of people struggle with the chaos, and with understanding, well, how can I get involved? Who&#8217;s the person in charge that I need to talk to? Everyone is in charge, so you talk to everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s not like if you&#8217;re in the corporate world where you just whip out the company Rolodex, for want of a better word, and you discover that, oh okay, they&#8217;re in charge of that department, that&#8217;s them. It&#8217;s a little bit more fine grain and nuanced, and things change all the time, and somebody&#8217;s gone on holiday. I love that then. So there is a kind of chaotic element to it, which I think you embrace, I guess. This is just the way it works, and it&#8217;s probably got massive upsides, as well as some interesting downsides as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the project, it feels like, since the dawn of the internet, so whenever that was, Tim Berners Lee, 35 years or whatever. Open source, at the beginning of the internet, was a real crucial underpinning for all sorts of things. The servers that we use, the CMSs that we use, and so open source projects just popped up everywhere. But then it feels, more recently, that competitive, market-based, commercial CMSs have come along, with probably a corporate governance structure. So not as transparent, but maybe more top down. So perhaps easier to manage in that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have any feelings, or misgivings about open source in the near future, because of the competitive landscape that a CMS finds itself in now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:50] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> I think that ultimately open source always wins. I think that you are better off betting on open source. I saw a tweet the other day about someone that has a shop on Shopify, and they woke up one morning and Shopify had turned them off. And they were like, well, our target was to make $25 million this year, but now it might be zero, because this decision by this company was to turn us off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thankfully with WordPress, you don&#8217;t have to deal with that. WordPress cannot turn a site off. WordPress cannot decide that a specific website is no longer going to be allowed to use WordPress. WordPress has the benefit of the GPL, GNU public license. And in that there are the four freedoms, and one of those is the freedom to run the software in any way you choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that freedom, I think, ultimately is what gives open source its power, and its sustainability. WordPress itself is a fork of another project. I am never upset if someone says, well, I&#8217;m going to fork WordPress to do this, it&#8217;s like, okay. If your software is going to be better, that&#8217;s awesome. Open source wins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not someone that&#8217;s ever been a big Drupal user, but I love Drupal. Drupal&#8217;s open source software. I don&#8217;t view Drupal as the enemy of WordPress. I think that, if a site wants to use Drupal because that&#8217;s the best open source software, or the best software it can find, awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has been lucky to, you know, at various times, collaborate with people in the Drupal community. A number of years ago, I was running the WordPress meetup in Washington DC, and we organised what we refer to as the open source barbecue. And so it was the WordPress meetup, the PHP meetup, the Android meetup, and the jQuery meetup. And we just threw a barbecue for 200 people to come and celebrate open source, and eat barbecue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If we were just concentrating on the features, so not the ethics of owning the technology, who owns it, who gets to shut you down or not. Do you think that it&#8217;s easy for an open source project, of the breadth, and scale, and depth, and enormity of WordPress, to keep up with the features that the proprietary CMSs ship? Because they know their users, and because they don&#8217;t have to make decisions in committee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, they probably do but, you know, the committees are probably much smaller, and managed from the top down. And they can ship features like this, and like that. They don&#8217;t need to necessarily worry. It&#8217;s a difficult question to encapsulate, but do you understand where I&#8217;m going with that? They can ship features perhaps more quickly than WordPress can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:33] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> Absolutely. But I don&#8217;t think it is the ability to ship features quickly that leads to success. I think it&#8217;s the ability to ship the right features, and provide the right experience for users. And I think that experience includes the ability for them to decide to move. If you are not happy with your WordPress host, you can move hosts. If you are not happy with the agency that you are using, you can move agencies. If you are using a closed source CMS, your ability to move is a lot harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get locked in, and ultimately that is harder for you. It might mean that you get features quicker. It might mean that you get up and running quicker, but at what cost? Everything has a benefit, everything has a cost. And I think that the benefits of open source just drastically outweigh the costs of using it. The fact that you are going to deal with volunteers running your software project in many cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s the old XKCD article, which has the tiny twig of holding up the software is one random guy in Omaha, Nebraska. And as much as possible, I think one of the benefits of WordPress is that there&#8217;s very few things where it&#8217;s one twig being held up by a single person. There are very few parts of the code base that multiple committers aren&#8217;t familiar with. And the beauty of how it&#8217;s been developed is we can look back in many cases, and understand why changes were made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll see in, if you ever look at a WordPress commit, there&#8217;s often be a long section. There will be a one sentence description, and then there might be a paragraph or two explaining what the change is. And then there&#8217;s also links to tickets, and often very important, the props of who worked on it along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you can see, okay, well, these 15 people contributed to this. Oh, 12 of them aren&#8217;t active anymore, but there&#8217;s 3 of them that are. Maybe they remember, or I can look at the tickets that are referenced, and I can find the discussion that took place leading up to it. And that ticket, maybe that links to an IRC conversation from 15 years ago. We have the logs of that conversation, and can look back at what was discussed, and how did we get to this solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think history shows that people seem to like open source. You only have to look at the numbers, and the enormity of a lot of open source projects to realise that it definitely tends towards winning. I don&#8217;t know quite how to phrase that but, does that make sense? The graph tends towards open source on the whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay so, Aaron, given all of this, if somebody&#8217;s listening to this and they think, actually, I&#8217;d like to get into that, I&#8217;d be curious to see what this is like, dip my feet. Nobody&#8217;s suggesting that you have to show up and stay there for the rest of your life but, how do people begin this journey? Where are the best places to go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:36] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> So if you want to contribute to WordPress Core, and I hope that everyone does at some point in their life, the best way to get started is to join the new contributor chats, which take place biweekly in WordPress Slack. And so if you go to make.wordpress.org/chat, you can join the WordPress Slack. If you go to make.wordpress.org/core, you can see the Core discussions, and you can see the meetings that are taking place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get involved. Find a issue that is bothering you, or that you think is going to make WordPress better, and add your thoughts. Think about like, if someone isn&#8217;t thinking about this, what is going to get them to think about this? Add context, add information. Even if you are not someone that can write code, maybe you can quickly sketch out an idea, take a picture of that and upload it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you can share some data or share some stats from your company of, hey, this change took place and it&#8217;s actually caused a 10% drop for us in user signups. That is like, okay, well, that&#8217;s a data point that we can look at, and maybe use to come up to a better solution. This change would help speed up our website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also test the changes that other people have proposed. There is the WordPress Playground now, that allows you to very easily test out a change. Just earlier today, there&#8217;s a change that was being proposed for 6.6 to remove the revisions panel from the sidebar. And a handful of us were like, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s quite right, here&#8217;s some alternate ideas. And then someone coded one up. A couple people looked at it and we&#8217;re like, that&#8217;s not the right way, how about this other way? And it was coded up, and I tested it and just was like, all right, here&#8217;s what I see. And it just took a couple of clicks of my mouse. It wasn&#8217;t a hard process to test and share a little bit of feedback for the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it&#8217;s not all about committing code. There are many more ways that you could help Core. So it may be that you identify problems, or test possible things that could go in, and just give your opinions. There&#8217;s loads of different ways that you can help in this initiative. And I will make sure that the, bits and pieces that Aaron has mentioned today all make it into the show notes. If you go to wptavern.com/podcast, and search for this episode, you&#8217;ll be able to find the show notes all attached there. It only remains for me, Aaron, to ask, if anybody is interested in just connecting with you personally, do you have a favorite place online where you send people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:16] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> My WordPress site is my favorite place, which is at aaron.jorb.in. I&#8217;m also on a number of social media networks, generally with the username of Aaron Jorbin. A handful of them I think I use just Jorbin. Yeah, I would love to chat with people. If people see me at a WordCamp, please come up and talk to me. I can be a bit of an introvert at those, and so I might not approach people, but would love to chat with as many people as I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something I used to do, that I&#8217;m going to try to get back into is, one lunch during the WordCamp, I&#8217;d sit down at a random table and just ask people, so how do you use WordPress? And you never know who you&#8217;re going to meet, and what they&#8217;re going to have to share if you do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s nice. And by the way, I&#8217;m incredibly jealous of your domain name. That&#8217;s just a stroke of luck that there&#8217;s a whole top level domain with your final two letters of your name in there. That&#8217;s lovely. I&#8217;ll add that into the show notes as well. But, Aaron Jorbin, thank you so much for chatting to me today. A real pleasure, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:14] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> Thank you so much for having me.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Aaron Jorbin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron has led teams responsible for some of the largest and most prominent WordPress sites in the world including Rolling Stone, Variety, WIRED, The New Yorker, and The White House. He is also a WordPress Core Committer who focuses on improving developer happiness and making the internet usable by everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s been an integral part of the WordPress community since 2010, and today Aaron opens up about the crucial importance of major and minor WordPress releases, and the need for user trust, which forms the backbone for features like auto updates that enhance WordPress security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the process behind WordPress releases, discussing how major and minor updates are planned and executed. Aaron explains the dynamics of the Core Committer community, a group of around 100 dedicated individuals, about 50 of whom are currently active, whose decisions and hard work keep WordPress robust, up to date and secure. The commitment to transparency, minimal egos, and the ability to handle criticism are mentioned as key elements for maintaining trust inside this community within a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about how communication and decision-making take place mostly in public forums, ensuring openness and collaboration. The conversation also touches on the ebb and flow of volunteer and sponsored contributors, the challenges of coordinating across global time zones, and the need for asynchronous decision making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron explains what it takes to move from a small contributor to a key player in the WordPress ecosystem, emphasising the burden of responsibility that comes with making changes affecting millions of non-technical users. Whether you&#8217;re a developer, tester, or enthusiastic user, Aaron encourages contributions in various forms, from sharing ideas to testing and providing feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered how WordPress is maintained and updated, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.condenast.com/\">Condé Nast</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/03/28/grunt-patch-wordpress-1-0-0/\">Grunt Patch WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/\">Previous WordPress releases</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/\">Drupal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/wordpressdc/\">WordPress DC meetup</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://xkcd.com/2347/\">Dependency cartoon from xkcd</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">WordPress Slack</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/playground/\">WordPress Playground</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in/\">Aaron&#8217;s website</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"Akismet: What is reCAPTCHA?

You probably get spam phone calls, spam texts, and spam emails. <em>You’ve won a prize. You’ve broken a copyright law. You’ve placed an order and need to verify your account details.</em> <em>You can make $3,956 a day working from home doing this one cool trick</em>. It sucks up our time and, if we fall for it, can be downright dangerous.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there’s also spam on many websites. Comment sections filled with links to less-than-reputable pages designed to phish for sensitive info or initiate a malware download.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For site owners, spammy comment sections, fake user registrations, and false contact form submissions can add hours of work each week, make your site seem less legitimate, and put visitors and your entire reputation at risk.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s where reCAPTCHA comes in. Owned by Google, reCAPTCHA is a free service that distinguishes real human users from automated bots. But there are pros and cons to implementing reCAPTCHA on your site, so you’ll need to weigh your options carefully in order to find an effective solution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>In this post, we’ll take a closer look at reCAPTCHA and how it works. Then, we’ll explore the main drawbacks of reCAPTCHA, and consider a better alternative. Let’s jump right&nbsp;in!</p>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-284031\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is&nbsp;reCAPTCHA?</h2>\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA is a free Google service that protects websites from spam. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-captcha/\">CAPTCHA tests</a> were first introduced in 1997 as an extra layer of security against hackers and bots.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tests were deployed primarily on login pages and <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-add-wordpress-contact-form/\">contact form pages</a>. They generated distorted text and users had to decipher the words to pass the test. Since then, CAPTCHAs have become more complex to keep up with evolving technologies and bots.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>The advanced nature of CAPTCHA can cause problems for the user experience (UX) since it demands more input from site visitors. In fact, reCAPTCHA (introduced in 2007) presents more complicated challenges like puzzles and image identification, which typically require user&nbsp;interaction.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"434\" height=\"627\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image.png\" alt=\"example of a CAPTCHA with images of cars\" class=\"wp-image-284033\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, reCAPTCHA was acquired by Google. The original version is no longer available since it was found to be too easy for bots (using algorithms trained in pattern recognition) and too difficult for humans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>So now, there are different versions of reCAPTCHA, which we’ll explore later in the&nbsp;post.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-does-recaptcha work\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does reCAPTCHA&nbsp;work?</h2>\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA uses artificial intelligence (AI) to differentiate between humans and bots. While the traditional CAPTCHA issued tests before allowing visitor access, algorithms trained in pattern recognition could quickly solve these challenges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, reCAPTCHA was introduced. As we discussed, the original version is no longer in use, but there are still two versions available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA v2 requires users to select images or check the “I’m not a robot”&nbsp;box.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"371\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1.png\" alt=\"example form with ReCAPTCHA\" class=\"wp-image-284034\" />\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, reCAPTCHA v3 aims to minimize the disruption to the user experience. Instead of requiring user interaction, it calculates scores based on user behavior. The website administrator can then allow or block access, but they can also issue further v2 tests, if needed, for&nbsp;verification.</p>\n\n<p>The latest version of reCAPTCHA (v3) uses a JavaScript API to determine a score between 0 and 1. While a score of 0 is judged to be a bot, a score of 1 is almost always a human user. It uses a concept called “actions” which lets you define steps in your typical user&nbsp;journey.</p>\n\n\n<p>This way, the reCAPTCHA technology learns how real users interact with your site so that it’s able to detect bot traffic. In fact, some websites deploy reCAPTCHA across all pages so that the technology has more user activity to work with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"distinction-between-captcha-and recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Distinction between CAPTCHA and&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</h2>\n\n<p>You might still be wondering about the <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/akismet-vs-captcha-vs-recaptcha/\">difference between CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA</a>. First off, CAPTCHA is an umbrella term used to describe any website authentication test to separate humans from&nbsp;bots.</p>\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, reCAPTCHA is a type of CAPTCHA test owned by Google. Note that there are several types of CAPTCHAs owned by different companies, and reCAPTCHA is just one of many.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>As we discussed, the original reCAPTCHA test was much more simplistic, primarily relying on word tests disguised with twisted letters. But now, there are different types of reCAPTCHA including images, checkboxes, and tests that require no user input at&nbsp;all.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-different-types-of recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The different types of&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</h2>\n\n<p>Now, let’s take a look at all <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/recaptcha-v2-vs-v3/\">the different versions of&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"recaptcha-v1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA v1</h3>\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA v1 isn’t widely used anymore and was discontinued by Google in 2018. But this version of reCAPTCHA came the closest to emulating the traditional CAPTCHA tests that relied on object&nbsp;recognition.</p>\n\n\n<p>In this instance, a user would be presented with a pair of words, one of which functioned as a control word and could be understood by a bot. The other word could only be recognized by human users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>This CAPTCHA method was developed in the late 1990s and continued to be used throughout the 2010s. It also started using scanned words and photographs to make the tests more challenging, but it has since been replaced with more sophisticated reCAPTCHA&nbsp;tests.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"recaptcha-v2\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA v2</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After reCAPTCHA v1 was shut down, it was replaced with reCAPTCHA v2, which currently consists of three versions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one is the reCAPTCHA v2 for Android, which is an API that can protect Android apps from bot traffic. The API integrates directly into Android apps, and in an attempt to preserve the UX, the API allows low-risk users to pass through easily. When needed, the API will present a challenge to the user to verify that they are human.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s the reCAPTCHA v2 that most users are familiar with. This is the “I’m not a robot” checkbox. In this case, all that users have to do is check the box, rather than solve a complex test or problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>As such, it’s considered more user&#8209;friendly than previous methods. Though it sounds simple, Google analyzes various factors like mouse movement and browsing history to detect bot&nbsp;activity.</p>\n\n\n<p>Even more sophisticated is the invisible reCAPTCHA badge which requires no user input at all. Similar to the previous method, Google evaluates activities like mouse movement and typing patterns. This version of reCAPTCHA is triggered via a JavaScript API call or when a user clicks on a button.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s still not a perfect solution since sophisticated bots that use AI technology can bypass the reCAPTCHA. And, it isn’t immune to CAPTCHA farms — which are businesses that employ human workers to solve reCAPTCHAs to aid cybercriminals and hackers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"recaptcha-v3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA v3</h3>\n\n\n<p>In further attempts to improve the UX, Google introduced reCAPTCHA v3, which works similarly to the invisible reCAPTCHA badge. This version of reCAPTCHA works in the background, so it’s completely invisible to users and presents no&nbsp;tests.</p>\n\n<p>The reCAPTCHA v3 method tracks all requests made by a user on a website, and every request is given a score between 0 and 1. As we discussed earlier, a score close to 0 is likely to be a bot whereas a score closer to 1 is judged as&nbsp;human.</p>\n\n\n<p>The interactions monitored by the reCAPTCHA vary between websites. For instance, the administrator can provide examples of normal user interactions&nbsp;so that the reCAPTCHA can pick up on any deviation from the norm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA v3 is the best version of the technology in terms of efficacy and UX. That said, it’s more difficult to implement since the scores must be defined by the administrator, which can be time&#8209;consuming to set&nbsp;up.</p>\n\n\n<p>With this in mind, you might automatically block users who return a score below 0.2. Then, scores between 0.2 and 0.6 may generate a CAPTCHA challenge to verify that the user is human.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, any score above 0.6 may instantly be granted access. The issue is that a strict scoring system holds the potential to block out legitimate users while a lenient system may allow bots to bypass the reCAPTCHA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"challenges-and-downsides-of recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenges and downsides of&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</h2>\n\n\n<p>Now that you know the different types of reCAPTCHA, let’s take a look at the main limitations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-impact-on-users-with disabilities\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Impact on users with&nbsp;disabilities</h3>\n\n\n<p>It’s imperative to design web content in a way that’s accessible to people with disabilities. This way, your enterprise site can comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>The problem is that many reCAPTCHA tests are visual and require users to identify images or text. This has been shown to <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3524010.3539498\">discriminate against users with visual impairments</a>. And since they’re designed to be unreadable by machines, screen readers are unable to interpret&nbsp;them.</p>\n\n\n<p>Additionally, audio reCAPTCHA tests alienate users with hearing impairments. Meanwhile, the mathematical equation tests are believed to be more accessible to users with vision impairments, but these can exclude those with cognitive disorders like dyscalculia.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-annoyance-and frustration\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Annoyance and&nbsp;frustration</h3>\n\n<p>Many users may find reCAPTCHA annoying. When you expect instant access to a page, and instead you’re required to check a box or complete a task, it’s natural to become&nbsp;frustrated.</p>\n\n<p>This can lead to early exits. High bounce rates can send signals to search engines that users don’t find your website valuable. Therefore, it can result in both traffic and revenue&nbsp;loss.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"3-data-collection-and-privacy concerns\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Data collection and privacy&nbsp;concerns</h3>\n\n<p>In order to differentiate between bots and humans, reCAPTCHA v3 and the invisible reCAPTCHA badge analyze data like mouse navigation and click patterns. Since this is classified as personal data, this method of reCAPTCHA requires privacy&nbsp;compliance.</p>\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of laws and legislations that exist to protect user privacy on the internet. Most notable, perhaps, is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, but there’s also the Colorado Privacy Act, the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and many more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Therefore, it’s important to gather consent from users if you plan to implement reCAPTCHA. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/console/policies/privacy-policy-guide\">Google recommends a privacy policy</a> that informs users of the data collected, the data shared, and a statement that tells users how the data will be&nbsp;used.</p>\n\n\n<p>That said, this is considered the bare minimum in terms of privacy, so it’s useful to have a proper look into what should be included. This is very important since non-compliance can damage your reputation, erode customer trust, and lead to heavy financial penalties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-recaptchaâs-decreasing effectiveness\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. reCAPTCHA’s decreasing&nbsp;effectiveness</h3>\n\n\n<p>Another potential problem with reCAPTCHA is its effectiveness given the emergence of artificial intelligence. In fact, researchers from the University of Columbia <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7467367\">created reCAPTCHA attacks</a> that managed to solve 70 percent of all challenges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>This shows that reCAPTCHA is no longer as effective as it once was, whether that’s down to AI, CAPTCHA farms, or internal logic. What’s more, reCAPTCHA v3 requires the analysis of user&nbsp;behavior.</p>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA needs a large volume of data to determine normal human interactions and tell them apart from bots. But this technology relies on a client&#8209;side fingerprinting approach, which advanced bots can bypass&nbsp;easily.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5-potential-for-false positives\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Potential for false&nbsp;positives</h3>\n\n\n<p>The final drawback to reCAPTCHA is that there is still the potential for false positives, which can block legitimate users from your site. For instance, enterprises that prioritize security may adopt a strict scoring system for reCAPTCHA v3. This makes it harder for users to score 1.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give you an example, many administrators grant low scores to users who submit forms very quickly. That said, some human users are naturally quick typers, but going by this system, they may be flagged and denied access to your website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, researchers from the University of Toronto found that <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.01003\">reCAPTCHA gives lower scores</a> to users who don’t have a Google account. Therefore, privacy-conscious visitors who use private browsers or VPNs are more likely to be mistaken for bots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"akismet-the-better-alternative-to recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: The better alternative to&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</h2>\n\n<p>Considering the challenges and drawbacks of reCAPTCHA, you may be cautious about deploying it on your website. Instead, you might prefer an alternative anti&#8209;spam solution that is more inclusive and doesn’t disrupt the&nbsp;UX.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a> was developed by Automattic (the same team behind WordPress.com) and it’s one of the <a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">leading anti&#8209;spam plugins</a>. It protects you against form, comment, and text&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"732\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2.png\" alt=\"Akismet homepage with the text \" />\n\n\n<p>Since 2005, Akismet has removed over 500 billion pieces of spam across 100 million sites. The plugin is powered by machine learning, which explains how Akismet detects spam with a 99.99 percent accuracy&nbsp;rating.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike reCAPTCHA, Akismet doesn’t require too much from your visitors. Instead, it operates behind the scenes, so it doesn’t add friction to your UX. This means that users may be more likely to stay on your website, helping you <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/form-conversion-rate/\">get more conversions</a> and&nbsp;sales.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-akismet works\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Akismet&nbsp;works</h2>\n\n<p>Akismet analyzes every piece of user&#8209;submitted content to prevent a range of online attacks. This analysis takes place in real time, so you can block suspicious activity before it even reaches your&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n<p>It’s best to think of Akismet as a filter, where legitimate submissions are allowed to pass through, but spam submissions are denied. This saves you from manually reviewing every&nbsp;submission.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned earlier, Akismet is powered by machine learning algorithms. This enables the plugin to compare the content of submissions against a database of known spam. Plus, it integrates with popular form plugins, so you’re not limited to <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/comment-spam/\">blog comment&nbsp;spam</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>You’ll also get access to monthly and annual spam charts. This way, you can check your spam accuracy rating, false positives, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>The Akismet plugin is simple to install on WordPress, but you will need an API key to connect to the Akismet&nbsp;database.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-akismet-over recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of Akismet over&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</h2>\n\n\n<p>Now that you know more about Akismet, let’s look at the benefits of using this plugin over reCAPTCHA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-improved accessibility\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Improved&nbsp;accessibility</h3>\n\n<p>As we discussed earlier, one of the limitations of reCAPTCHA is that some versions require users to decipher visual or auditory information. Other versions contain mathematical equations or ask users to complete&nbsp;checkboxes.</p>\n\n\n<p>This can exclude those with cognitive, hearing, or visual impairments. Therefore, if you want to keep an accessible website, you’re better off <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/captcha-alternatives/\">using a CAPTCHA alternative</a> like Akismet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet doesn’t require any user interaction. It works silently behind the scenes, so users can submit content without running into any obstacles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-enhanced-user experience\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Enhanced user&nbsp;experience</h3>\n\n\n<p>All kinds of reCAPTCHA (except v3) add friction to the user experience, as they require individuals to check a box or complete a test. This delays access to a page or resource, which can lead to frustration on the user’s part.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Akismet doesn’t interfere with the UX. It operates in the background, so most users aren’t even aware of it. Additionally, the spam data is stored in the cloud, so the plugin doesn’t impact site&nbsp;speed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"3-privacy protection\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Privacy&nbsp;protection</h3>\n\n\n<p>While reCAPTCHA can reduce spam submissions, it does so by gathering personal data, which means you have to obtain explicit consent from users. Plus, privacy-conscious users may be perturbed by data collection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet also collects personal data, but only that which is needed to carry out spam protection. According to the GDPR, this is classified as a “legitimate interest” use of that data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the plugin settings, you can easily enable a privacy notice that informs users about this. The company never sells personal data gathered through the plugin. You can check out the <a href=\"https://automattic.com/privacy/\">full privacy policy here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-better-spam detection\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Better spam&nbsp;detection</h3>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA is primarily an anti&#8209;spam measure, but the <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/do-captcha-and-recaptcha-protect-wordpress-sites-from-bots/\">effectiveness of reCAPTCHA</a> has been challenged by advances in AI technology and the growth of CAPTCHA&nbsp;farms.</p>\n\n<p>Akismet has a long reputation for detecting spam with very high accuracy. Currently, the plugin boasts an overall accuracy score of 99.99 percent, but you can view the exact spam accuracy score within your Akismet&nbsp;dashboard.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5-reduced-false positives\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Reduced false&nbsp;positives</h3>\n\n<p>Earlier, we mentioned the fact that some versions of reCAPTCHA frequently result in false positives which block legitimate users from websites. This is especially true in the case of reCAPTCHA v3 (where administrators have to define their own rules) and for users who opt for private browsers and VPNs. Not only is this frustrating for users, but it can also result in revenue loss for&nbsp;organizations.</p>\n\n\n<p>With Akismet, submissions are analyzed in real time and with incredible accuracy. Additionally, there are systems in place that make it easy for websites to <a href=\"https://akismet.com/support/general/akismet-unblocking-a-spam/\">report false positives</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to forms, you can simply remove submissions from the spam list. For comments, all you have to do is check the relevant boxes and use the <strong>Bulk actions </strong>dropdown menu to select <strong>Not spam.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked questions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently asked&nbsp;questions</h2>\n\n<p>This guide has answered questions like “what is reCAPTCHA” and “how does reCAPTCHA work”, but you may still be looking for clarification on this technology. We’ll answer some other common questions in the next&nbsp;section.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-primary-purpose-of recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the primary purpose of&nbsp;reCAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n\n<p>The primary purpose of reCAPTCHA is to differentiate human users from bots in order to block spam and other forms of online abuse. It is a type of technology that deploys adaptive challenges like image identification and checkboxes that detect suspicious behavior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-does-recaptcha-differentiate-between-a-human-and-a bot\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does reCAPTCHA differentiate between a human and a&nbsp;bot?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Depending on the version of reCAPTCHA, different factors are considered to distinguish between bots and humans. For example, some reCAPTCHA tests track cursor movement, typing patterns, and browser history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA v3 evaluates these factors to generate scores. Scores closer to 0 are judged to be bots while those closer to 1 are considered human.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-key-differences-between-recaptcha-v2-and v3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the key differences between reCAPTCHA v2 and&nbsp;v3?</h3>\n\n\n<p>There are some key differences between reCAPTCHA v2 and v3. reCAPTCHA v2 includes three different methods including the Android API, the “I’m not a robot” checkbox, and the invisible reCAPTCHA badge. All of these, except the badge, require user interaction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA v3 doesn’t require user input. Instead, it monitors certain factors like mouse movement and typing patterns to return a score between 0 and 1, which helps systems detect bot traffic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"is-recaptcha-completely-effective-against-bots-and-automated attacks\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is reCAPTCHA completely effective against bots and automated&nbsp;attacks?</h3>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA is an <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/best-anti-spam-wordpress-plugins-compared/\">anti&#8209;spam service</a> that attempts to block bots and prevent automated attacks like distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The problem is that several researchers have questioned the effectiveness of reCAPTCHA. For instance, researchers from the University of Columbia launched low&#8209;risk bot attacks that solved over 70 percent of all&nbsp;challenges.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-does-recaptcha-impact-the-overall-user-experience-on websites\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does reCAPTCHA impact the overall user experience on&nbsp;websites?</h3>\n\n<p>Most versions of reCAPTCHA require users to solve mathematical problems, decipher images and text, or simply check a box. While this may not sound too problematic, it adds friction to the user&nbsp;experience.</p>\n\n\n<p>It delays users from accessing the desired page or resource, which can be frustrating. In turn, this can lead to early exits — which affect bounce rates, traffic volume, revenue, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"can-recaptcha-be-bypassed-or-tricked-by-sophisticated bots\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can reCAPTCHA be bypassed or tricked by sophisticated&nbsp;bots?</h3>\n\n\n<p>There are ways for cybercriminals and bots to bypass reCAPTCHA tests. To do this, all they have to do is raise the trust score by mimicking normal human behavior on a web browser.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can achieve this effect by using a resistant TLS fingerprint. Plus, hackers can execute JavaScript using browser automation tools, and rotate JavaScript fingerprint details.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-implications-of-recaptcha-for-user privacy\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the implications of reCAPTCHA for user&nbsp;privacy?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Since reCAPTCHA gathers personal data about the user’s browser and device, certain states and countries require companies to get user consent. In particular, the GDPR ensures that visitors know how websites use, process, and store their information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, you’ll need to obtain explicit consent. It’s also important to display a privacy policy on your site. Otherwise, you may encounter hefty financial penalties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"are-there-any-alternatives-to-recaptcha-that-offer-similar-or-better functionalities\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there any alternatives to reCAPTCHA that offer similar or better&nbsp;functionalities?</h3>\n\n<p>Although reCAPTCHA is capable of blocking some spam, it can interfere with the UX and discriminate against those with disabilities. Therefore, you might prefer a more user&#8209;friendly alternative, like&nbsp;Akismet.</p>\n\n\n<p>Akismet works in the background of your site, so it requires no user interaction. It also filters spam with an impressive accuracy rating of 99.99 percent, which means it rarely produces false positives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-accurate-is-akismet-at-stopping spam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How accurate is Akismet at stopping&nbsp;spam?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet filters comment, form, and text spam with a 99.99 percent accuracy rate. Plus, it analyzes submissions in real time to maximize threat protection. And there are systems in place to report false positives, which makes Akismet much more effective than&nbsp;reCAPTCHA.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-many-sites-use akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How many sites use&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet is installed on over 100 million websites, and the plugin has blocked over 500 billion spam submissions. Better yet, it’s trusted by plenty of enterprise brands like Microsoft, ConvertKit, Bluehost, and&nbsp;WordPress.com.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"are-there-any-case-studies-of-companies-that-use akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there any case studies of companies that use&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n<p>If you want to know how Akismet has helped real brands, you can check out some case studies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/convertkit-customerstory/\">ConvertKit</a> implemented Akismet to filter out spam and automate spam prevention. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/saying-no-to-spam-on-smitten-kitchens-popular-food-site/\">Smitten Kitchen</a> automated spam detection in the comments section of recipes, which has helped prevent the presence of affiliate links and irrelevant promotions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"where-can-i-learn-more-about akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where can I learn more about&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about the service, you can find a lot of <a href=\"https://akismet.com/resources/\">free resources</a>. Akismet also has a <a href=\"https://akismet.com/support/\">dedicated support page</a> to help you set up and use the plugin. And the <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/\">Akismet blog</a> is frequently updated with useful articles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"akismet-the-best-spam-solution-for-your website\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: The best spam solution for your&nbsp;website</h2>\n\n<p>Spam is a concern for any site administrator, since it can make your site appear less trustworthy and lead to cyberattacks. While reCAPTCHA is one solution for preventing spam, it may not be the best option in terms of user&nbsp;experience.</p>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA v3 runs in the background of your site, but it can still be frustrating for visitors. Additionally, it can exclude those with disabilities and incorrectly block legitimate visitors. Therefore, you might prefer a better alternative, like&nbsp;Akismet.</p>\n\n<p>With a 99.99 percent accuracy rating, Akismet is excellent at blocking comment, form, and text spam.

I loved drawing with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint\">MacPaint</a> and found it much cooler than my <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch\">Etch A Sketch</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, my parents got a Windows 95 computer and we were connected to the internet. My parents would check for important calls before unhooking the telephone to plug in the computer. When Google search came out, my family would sit around the screen, amazed at the “dozens” of search results. We even played a game to see whose name got the most results. I won by a long shot because my middle name Luke (Japanese: ルカ) appears in the word “digital camera” (デジタルカメラ).</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>In junior high, I joined the table tennis club but quickly realized sports weren’t my thing. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I switched to the computer club, where I edited my first video, learned about spreadsheets and word processors, and built my first website using a Japanese software called Homepage Builder. I started maintaining a website for my church, self-teaching myself about staging environments and FTP through help docs and online manuals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In senior high, I started looking at the HTML code produced by Homepage Builder. I realized I didn’t have to use the drag-and-drop editor to make edits and taught myself basic HTML and CSS. That’s when I created my first game, an HTML game where players clicked on doors to navigate a maze. I remember someone “hacked” my game by figuring out the URL logic and jumping to the goal. That was my introduction to cyber security and encryption.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-information-ethics-opened-my-eyes-to-the-diversity-in-the-world\">How information ethics opened my eyes to the diversity in the world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In university, I studied information science, which pulled me deeper into the tech world. I continued to master’s and doctorate programs, and started teaching tech classes at three universities. I taught in both Japanese and English to both undergraduate and postgraduate students. Subjects included programming basics (C, Java), informatics, and image processing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my most favorite subject was information ethics, which highlighted how different cultures have varying ethical values in tech. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>For instance, some communities pirate software out of necessity, some share login credentials to bypass censorship, while other communities consider both these practices unethical. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Teaching this course really opened my eyes to global diversity. It taught me the importance of open dialogue, empathetic listening, and creative thinking.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-i-met-wordpress\">How I met WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I first heard about WordPress in my university lab. A senior student returning from overseas said it was all the hype in the west, so we moved our lab’s website to WordPress. I didn’t fully understand what WordPress was then, but I decided to ride the hype and move my church websites to WordPress too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since making the switch in 2014, WordPress has become my Content Management System (CMS) of choice. I tried a brief stint with Wix, but it just confirmed my loyalty to WordPress. And after joining Automattic, I discovered the community behind the software and my love for WordPress has grown even more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-i-joined-automattic-and-the-wordpress-community\">How I joined Automattic and the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At one point, I installed the VideoPress plugin on one of my sites and needed support with a subscription mix-up. The agent resolved my issue in one email and signed off as a “Happiness Engineer,” which made me smile. Years later, I saw a job opening for Happiness Engineers at <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> and remembered that interaction. I volunteered on the WordPress.com support forums for a couple months building up my support skills before getting accepted into Automattic in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon after joining, I learned that WordPress is more than just a CMS. It’s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">a community</a> built on open-source principles. I didn’t wait long to attend my local WordPress Meetups later that year, and was amazed at the selflessness and dedication of the participants. At those Meetups, I learned the WordPress ecosystem extends beyond the community that creates it. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>WordPress is composed of the people who use it &#8211; the developers, designers, analysts, hobbyists, hosts, marketers, etc. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a common bond that brings people together from different walks of life to a safe space of diversity and acceptance. It was the first time I had interacted with people quite like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-my-journey-in-the-wordpress-training-team\">My journey in the WordPress Training Team</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, the pandemic canceled in-person events, but I had opportunities to be part of educational projects within Automattic. I coached Japanese support agents, created internal training materials, and developed a new onboarding program for new employees. These experiences rekindled my love for education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was around that time that WordPress launched its educational site, <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a>. I was selected for an internal position at Automattic to become a full time contributor to the Learn WordPress initiative, and joined the WordPress project’s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">Training Team</a> in June 2022. I started in the team by understanding the team’s values, priorities, and challenges. Over the next six months, I worked on improving team processes and documentation. At the end of 2022, I was honored to be nominated as a team rep, since which I’ve led projects like migrating from Trello to GitHub and building an onboarding program. These efforts have increased team member engagement and activity, which in turn is contributing to traffic and engagement increases on the Learn WordPress site, too.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id7139_e29120-08 alignfull has-theme-palette1-background-color kt-row-has-bg wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-3-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top kb-theme-content-width\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column7139_ab010b-f3\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ben-wordcamp-asia-2023.jpg\" class=\"kb-advanced-image-link\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ben-wordcamp-asia-2023-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Evans at WordCamp Asia 2023\" class=\"kb-img wp-image-7148\" /></a>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column7139_f7f196-5a\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ben-at-wordcamp-tokyo-2023.jpg\" class=\"kb-advanced-image-link\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"579\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ben-at-wordcamp-tokyo-2023-1024x579.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Evans at WordCamp Tokyo 2023\" class=\"kb-img wp-image-7149\" /></a>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column7139_fcf7c6-6d\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ben-wrodcamp-europe-2024-scaled.jpg\" class=\"kb-advanced-image-link\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ben-wrodcamp-europe-2024-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Evans at WordCamp Europe 2024\" class=\"kb-img wp-image-7150\" /></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpress-a-safe-space-to-be-authentic\">WordPress &#8211; a safe space to be authentic</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reflecting on my tech journey, the moments I felt most energized were when I contributed to creating a safe space of diversity and acceptance. Teaching information ethics laid the foundation, customer support as a Happiness Engineer let me practice this in 1:1 interactions, onboarding new employees allowed me to create these spaces for larger groups, and contributing to the WordPress Training Team extended this to a global community. These were moments when I felt most authentic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a safe space where one can be authentic isn’t a one-time project; it’s formed through humble and curious interactions. Every conversation can either build or destroy safety. I remember the excitement of my first WordPress Meetup, where I felt accepted for who I am. My hope is that everyone who interacts with the WordPress community experiences that same acceptance. I look forward to continuing contributing to this safe space &#8211; WordPress &#8211; so that both I and those around me can continue to be our authentic selves.</p>\n\n\n<div

技術との触れ合い</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>私が初めて IT 技術と触れ合ったのは、小学校に入学したころ、親のマッキントッシュ・コンピューターを通してでした。<a href=\"https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint\">MacPaint</a> でのお絵描きが大好きで、それまで遊んでいた <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch\">Etch A Sketch</a> よりもはるかにかっこいいと感じました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>その後、親が Windows 95 コンピューターを購入し、インターネットに接続しました。両親は重要な電話がくる予定がないかを確認してから電話線を外し、コンピューターを接続していました。Google 検索が登場したとき、家族で画面の周りに集まり、「数十件」もの検索結果に驚いていました。私たちは、誰の名前が最も多くの検索結果を引き出すかを競うゲームもしました。私のミドルネーム「ルカ」が「デジタルカメラ」に含まれているため、私が圧倒的に勝ちました。</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>中学では卓球部に入りましたが、スポーツが自分に合わないとすぐに気付きました。</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>そこでコンピュータークラブに転部し、初めてのビデオ編集、スプレッドシートやワードプロセッサの学習、そしてホームページビルダーという日本のソフトウェアを使った初めてのウェブサイト作成を経験しました。その頃から教会のウェブサイトの管理を始め、ステージング環境や FTP についてヘルプドキュメントやオンラインマニュアルを読みながら独学で学びました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>高校では、ホームページビルダーが生成する HTML コードを見始め、ドラッグ＆ドロップエディタを使わずにサイトを編集できることに気付き、基本的な HTML と CSS も独学で習得しました。初めてのゲームを作成したのもその頃です。プレイヤーがドアをクリックして迷路を進む HTML ゲームでしたが、誰かが URL の論理を解読し、ゴールにいきなり飛ぶ「ハック」をしたことを覚えています。これが私のサイバーセキュリティと暗号化の世界への初めての導入でした。</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-情報倫理を通して多様性に目が開かれる\"><strong>情報倫理を通して多様性に目が開かれる</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>大学では情報科学を学び、IT 技術の世界にさらに深く入り込みました。修士課程と博士課程に進み、三つの大学で情報系の授業を教え始めました。日本語と英語の両方で、学部生と大学院生にプログラミングの基本（C、Java）、情報学、画像処理などを教えました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>しかし、最も好きだった科目は情報倫理でした。これは、様々な文化が IT 技術に対して異なる倫理的価値観を持っていることを強調するものでした。</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>例えば、あるコミュニティは必要に迫られてソフトウェアを海賊版で使用し、あるコミュニティは検閲を回避するためにログイン情報を共有し、他のコミュニティはこれらの行為を非倫理的と見なします。</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>この科目を教えることで、世界の多様性に目が開かれました。オープンな対話、共感的な聞き方、そして創造的な思考の重要性を強く感じました。</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpressとの出会い\"><strong>WordPressとの出会い</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>大学の研究室で初めて WordPress について聞きました。海外から帰国した先輩が、西洋ではこれが大人気だと言って、研究室の Web サイトを WordPress に移行しました。その時は WordPress が何であるか完全には理解していませんでしたが、流行に乗って自分が管理していた教会のウェブサイトも WordPress に移行しました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2014年に移行して以来、私がサイトを作るときのコンテンツ管理システム（CMS）の選択肢は WordPress 一択になりました。Wix を試したこともありましたが、WordPress への忠誠を再確認するだけでした。その後 Automattic に入社し、ソフトウェアの背後にあるコミュニティを発見した時には、WordPress への愛がさらに深まりました。</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-automattic-と-wordpress-コミュニティへの参加\"><strong>Automattic と WordPress コミュニティへの参加</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>ある時、私のサイトに VideoPress プラグインをインストールした際、サブスクリプションの問題でサポートが必要でした。担当者はただ一通のメールで問題を解決し、署名には「ハピネス・エンジニア」と書いていました。それを読んだ時、私は笑顔になりました。数年後<a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">、Automattic</a> でハピネス・エンジニアの求人を見かけ、当時のやり取りを思い出しました。私は WordPress.com のサポートフォーラムで数ヶ月ボランティアをしてサポートスキルを磨き、2019年に Automattic に入社しました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>入社して間もなく、WordPress は単なる CMS 以上のものであることを知りました。それはオープンソースの原則に基づく<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">コミュニティ</a>だったのです。その年の後半には地元の WordPress ミートアップに参加し、参加者の無私と献身に驚かされました。そのミートアップでは、WordPress がそれを作るコミュニティを超えて広がっていることを学びました。</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>WordPress は、使用する人々、すなわち開発者、デザイナー、解析者、趣味の人、ホスト、マーケティング担当者などで構成されていました。</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>それは異なる背景を持つ人々を、多様性と受容性を大切にする安全な場所に結びつける共通の絆です。そのような人々と初めて触れ合った瞬間でした。</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpress-トレーニングチームでの経験\"><strong>WordPress トレーニングチームでの経験</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>2020年、コロナ禍によって対面イベントが中止される中、Automattic 内で教育プロジェクトに参加する機会がありました。そこで日本のサポートチームを指導し、内部トレーニング資料を作成し、新入社員向けの新しい教育課程を開発しました。これらの経験は私の教育への想いを再燃させました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>その頃、WordPress は教育サイト <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a> を立ち上げました。私は Automattic 内でフルタイムのコントリビューター（貢献者）として Learn WordPress プログラムに参加するために指名され、2022年6月に WordPress プロジェクトの<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">トレーニングチーム</a>に加わりました。最初はチームの価値観、優先事項、そして課題を理解することから始めました。次の6ヶ月間で、チームのプロセスとドキュメントを改善するために取り組みました。2022年の終わりにはチーム代表に推薦され、Trello から GitHub へのシステム移行やオンボーディングプログラムの構築などのプロジェクトをリードしました。これらの努力はチームメンバーのエンゲージメントと活動を増加させ、その結果、Learn WordPress サイトへのトラフィックとエンゲージメントの増加にも寄与しています。</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap

技術との関わりを振り返ると、多様性と受容性を大切にする安全な場所を作ることに貢献していると感じた瞬間が最も活力を感じました。情報倫理の教育はその基盤を築き、ハピネス・エンジニアとしてのカスタマーサポートは1対1のやり取りでこれを実践させてくれました。新入社員の教育では、これをより大きなグループに対して作ることができ、WordPressトレーニングチームへの貢献はこれをグローバルなコミュニティにまで広げました。こういった働きをしている時こそ、自分は最も自分らしいと感じます。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>自分らしくいられる安全な場所を作ることは一度きりのプロジェクトではなく、謙虚で好奇心旺盛な人との関わりを通じて形成されます。すべての会話は安全を築くか、破壊するかのどちらかです。私は最初の WordPress ミートアップで感じた、受け入れられる喜びを鮮明に覚えています。私の希望は、WordPress コミュニティと触れ合うすべての人が、その同じ受容性を経験することです。私も周囲の人々も本当の自分であり続けるために、WordPress というこの安全な場所に貢献し続けることを楽しみにしています。</p>\n<p>The post <a

Welcome to the next episode of All Things WordPress and WooCommerce in regards to accessibility. My name is Anne Bovelett. I&#8217;m an accessibility specialist. I have a lot to say about accessibility, and I try to teach anyone who wants to hear it and probably those who don&#8217;t want to hear it too. Accessibility is very important. Since we&#8217;re talking e-commerce, we&#8217;re also talking about revenue. It doesn&#8217;t really matter why you make something accessible, as long as you do it. If your web shop is losing revenue by the thousands or millions because you&#8217;re not making it accessible, you&#8217;d have good reason to do it, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that came out a bit harsh, but I don&#8217;t mean it that way. We&#8217;re trying to come from a kind place. One of the things we&#8217;ve learned lately is that people are saying, &#8220;We don&#8217;t know where to go. We don&#8217;t know who to turn to. We don&#8217;t know who to ask or who to trust.&#8221; I can understand that this is a very uneasy situation to be in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that if my co-host Taeke Reijenga could have been here today, he would have started filling us in on a lot of stuff in that regard. Unfortunately, due to personal circumstances, he couldn&#8217;t be here today, but he&#8217;ll probably be back next episode. So, let&#8217;s see how far we get today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This show is not just about the people that everybody already knows. We love the familiar faces, but it&#8217;s also about introducing some people you may not know yet. Today, I&#8217;m super excited to introduce Regine Gessner from the IAAP. I&#8217;ll ask her to explain what the IAAP is, who she is, what the IAAP is doing, and about an interesting discussion we had in December about certification. Hi Regine, welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />Hello Anne. Thank you very much for having me here today. I&#8217;m very happy to join in. My name is Regine Gessner, and I am working for the IAAP, which stands for the International Association of Accessibility Professionals, an association based in the U.S. The IAAP started 10 years ago and has developed several chapters in different regions. Four years ago, we started the German-speaking chapter, called IAAP DACH, which stands for Deutschland, Austria, and Switzerland. We are in charge of the German-speaking community and are the contact point for these countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IAAP&#8217;s mission is to network and exchange ideas. That&#8217;s one of our key pillars. Another is certification and advanced training. These are our key points. Since we started here in the German-speaking area, we have more than 350 members, including organizations. When you become a member, you are a member of the global IAAP, but then you will be directed to the region where you are based. Worldwide, IAAP has 6,500 members and about 220 organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s basically what the IAAP is. My position, since a bit more than a year ago, is to manage everything full-time, as it became too much to handle voluntarily. I am the main key contact for all people interested in membership and certifications. I&#8217;m the connection to the global team in the US and coordinate our working groups, board, and some of our tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Alright, so just for our audience, because we have mentioned certification several times, this is about the certification for specialists in accessibility in several disciplines. These certifications are sometimes a topic of discussion regarding their value and importance. We will get into that later on because this was the basis of our discussion in December.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons I asked you to join us today is because we know that in many organizations, regardless of size, it matters that you have people trained to maintain accessibility over time. Accessibility is not a one-off, is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />That&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s not a one-off; it&#8217;s an ongoing process. It&#8217;s not something that is done and then over. It&#8217;s something you have to start and build up capacity or competence in your company and teams. To implement it is not only technical but also a mindset in the people. That is very important and a key pillar. It must be obvious and natural that thinking about accessibility is part of the company or structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Let me ask you a controversial question. Do you think companies should make CPAC certification an obligatory certification for everybody working on their digital representation? Would that be a good idea?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />I would say yes. From my personal view, even as a newcomer in this topic, I did the CPAC certification, and it gave me a basic understanding of what we&#8217;re talking about. It covers disability models, types of disabilities, barriers people face in the digital world, what can help them, and what&#8217;s important to know when building a website, app, or documents. It&#8217;s not a technical certification but a basic knowledge one. So, I would recommend it as a good foundation when building your team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yeah. I&#8217;ve been thinking about this topic long and hard, especially now that we&#8217;re talking about it with this podcast. I hear a lot of companies say, &#8220;Making things accessible is too expensive.&#8221; But what if you integrate this into the core of your business? If it becomes second nature, getting the CPAC certification teaches you a lot about the why. And if you understand the why, it comes more naturally to a person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why I was asking this question. It&#8217;s tough because, in an ideal world, you&#8217;d want everyone certified. For example, if you own a web shop with a lot of people coding and creating content, you can say, &#8220;It&#8217;s expensive to remediate or keep fixing things.&#8221; But if you have to keep fixing things, it means people are doing things the wrong way. I would love to hear from our audience if they agree with this or why they disagree. Let&#8217;s discuss this in the next couple of weeks as people respond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing I wanted to ask you, the DACH chapter in Germany has about 350 members. While I&#8217;m happy there are so many members, I&#8217;m also worried because, with the upcoming legislation, it&#8217;s sad that the law has to push us to speed up a process we&#8217;ve been waiting for the past 20 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />Yes, I agree. In the beginning of 2023, we had about a hundred members, and now we&#8217;ve really increased. But for three countries, or even the whole world, having just 6,500 members in IAAP is not much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />But there is a great thing. It means there is opportunity for people working in web design, development, content creation, marketing, and communication to learn and expand their services. I&#8217;m sure many companies will want to do this and might outsource it. There are pros and cons to that, but let&#8217;s say our audience includes web shop owners, developers, designers, and other disciplines. If a web agency starts thinking about accessibility, learning about it, and expanding their services, what would you recommend from an IAAP point of view?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />If a company has no connection with accessibility yet, they can start by joining the community to network and learn. We offer several tools for our members to get in touch with each other, such as online breakfast meetings and networking events. These connections and exchanges are very valuable. Members can discuss their issues and concerns, and the group can help each other. This is very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />This is wonderful and very similar to the WordPress community, where we help each other succeed. It kept me coming back to WordPress in general. People exchange information and support each other. I hear complaints about Slack, and I’m one of them. Can you tell our listeners where they can go on your website to find out how to become a member and if they can talk to someone before becoming a member?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />It&#8217;s simple. They can email contact@iaap-dach.org, which is for the German-speaking region. This will come to me, and I can get in touch. I prefer personal calls to understand better. You don&#8217;t necessarily need to be a member to do certifications, but being a member has its benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Is the same approach available for the international department if people go to accessibilityassociation.org, or is this specific to the German chapter?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />We have several chapters, including a Nordic chapter for Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Iceland, a UK chapter, and a Mexican chapter. More chapters are in the process of starting. You are always welcome to contact the global colleagues from IAAP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />That&#8217;s wonderful because we have listeners from all over the world. Investing in accessibility can be costly for some, but it&#8217;s essential. Let&#8217;s discuss the December DACH region discussion about certification. People sometimes look for shortcuts to show certification without the proper intentions. There are also people with 10-20 years of experience who might question the need for certification. For example, someone who wrote the book on accessibility guidelines might be offered a junior salary because they lack certification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an interesting dialogue because certification is important. If someone gets certified, it means they learned a lot about the topic. There are several certifications, such as CPAC and WAS. Could you explain the prerequisites for the WAS certification?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />Yes, to start with the basic certification, CPAC, it gives you basic knowledge, but not expertise in digital accessibility. The WAS (Web Accessibility Specialist) certification requires a minimum of three years of documented roles and responsibilities in web accessibility. It’s not just enough to have knowledge of HTML or JavaScript; hands-on experience and knowledge of code elements and assistive technology are needed. This exam is for those with significant experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same applies to the ADS (Accessible Document Specialist) certification. These certifications are valid for three years and need to be renewed or maintained by collecting credential points through training or speaking at conferences. This ensures that knowledge stays current.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Accessibility is never a one-off, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />Exactly, it’s an ongoing process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />This brings up the importance of accredited courses, like those offered by the Accessibility Collective</p>\n\n\n\n<p>. They provide credits for IAAP certification, which helps ensure the courses give you long-term benefits. Companies need to understand where to find the correct information and how to avoid conflicting advice. Referring to the WCAG guidelines and talking to the IAAP are crucial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />I agree. The IAAP is not perfect, but we provide a platform, guidelines, and legislation. The discussion on certification is important, and there are many specialists with years of experience. They can use their references and tools to prove their expertise. The IAAP is one channel, but there are many pieces to the puzzle that help us on our way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yes, altogether we can take the fear out of doing accessibility right. Every time I speak to companies, I emphasize that accessibility is everyone’s task, not just one person&#8217;s. Support and teamwork are essential. If someone finds an issue, it’s about helping each other, not pointing fingers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone contacts you about an issue with your web shop, it’s a gift, even if it’s wrapped in anger. Engaging with them can turn them into ambassadors. Ignoring accessibility can mean losing potential customers, and it&#8217;s important to take these opportunities to improve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />Absolutely, everyone wants access to everything. For example, around 15% of people in Europe have some kind of disability and can&#8217;t use everything fully. This potential customer base is missed if your shop isn’t accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yes, there&#8217;s so much potential. Ignoring accessibility leaves about 13 trillion dollars on the table globally, which is larger than the Chinese economy. This includes all accessibility, not just digital. Restaurants not accessible to wheelchairs miss not just the person in the wheelchair, but also their friends and family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />Exactly, the whole group can&#8217;t go there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />So, if someone contacts you about an accessibility issue, consider it a valuable opportunity. Improving accessibility benefits everyone. Thank you so much, Regine, for coming on the show today at such short notice. Your insights were invaluable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />Thank you very much for having me. It was a pleasure to be here, and I will make sure to provide all necessary links and information for your audience to learn more about us, our certifications, member benefits, and events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Thank you. And thank you to Greyd in Munich for sponsoring this podcast. This has been a different show than usual, but flexibility is important. We&#8217;ll talk about WordCamp Europe next month. Thank you, Bob Dunn, and Do the Woo for giving us this platform to discuss digital accessibility, especially in e-commerce. If you have questions or comments, please reach out to us. Thank you and see you next month.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong>All Things WordPress and WooCommerce via our series on accessibility</strong>, host <strong>Anne Bovelett </strong>is joined by <strong>Regine Gessner </strong>from the<strong> International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP)</strong>, as they explore the role of certifications in accessibility, the challenges companies face, and practical steps for integrating accessibility into digital projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also address common misconceptions and the need for ongoing education and community support to ensure web accessibility becomes second nature in digital development.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Highlights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Introduction to Accessibility</strong>: Anne Bovelett emphasizes the importance of accessibility in e-commerce and its impact on revenue, stating that accessibility should be integral to digital projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>R<strong>ole of IAAP</strong>: Regine Gessner introduces the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP) and its mission to network, exchange ideas, offer certifications, and provide advanced training in accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Certification Importance</strong>: The discussion focuses on the value of certifications like CPAC and WAS in establishing credibility and knowledge in accessibility.

Welcome to another BizChat here on Do the Woo. My name is Marcus Burnett and I&#8217;m a community marketer with GoDaddy. I am here today with my wonderful co-host from Barn2 plugins, Katie. Keith, how are you today, Katie?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Hey, great, thanks. What about you, Marcus?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, not doing too bad. We&#8217;re spanning all parts of the globe today, so it&#8217;s morning for me, afternoon for you, and evening for our guest, but doing pretty good. As usual, we have an excellent guest, and like I said, today we&#8217;re spanning all different parts of the globe. Joining us today from the ecommerce Marketing suite of tools at Metorik is founder Bryce Adams. Welcome to the show, Bryce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Thanks, Marcus. Thanks, Katie. Thanks for having me. Yeah, it&#8217;s really cool to be back on a Do the Woo show. I think the last time I did was maybe half a decade ago. I don&#8217;t know. I love being able to say half a decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />But yeah, it&#8217;s cool to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Happy to have you here. Bryce is here to talk about a report he recently published on the State of WooCommerce at Scale. But first, would you please share with folks a little bit about yourself and your company, Metorik?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Sure, yeah. So my name is Bryce and my background in Woo, I guess, started at WooCommerce itself back in 2014. I was there initially in a support role and eventually in a development role. Then Automattic acquired Woo in 2015. So I joined that and that happened pretty quickly, and then left in 2016 to do Metorik. So that&#8217;s like eight years ago now. I guess the majority of my career has been spent on it. Metorik is basically an analytics and email automation tool for WooCommerce and for Shopify and maybe more platforms in the future. But primarily we started with WooCommerce back in 2015 and only really added Shopify a few years ago. The majority of the customers we have around the world are WooCommerce stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />So let&#8217;s move on to the report then. You&#8217;ve recently published an insights report based on the sites which are using Metorik with WooCommerce. Can you tell us a bit about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Yeah, for sure. It was something we wanted to do for a really long time. I think even a few years in, as it was starting to approach several thousand stores, I was starting to see trends and patterns. One of the most common feature requests we got was benchmarking and trying to understand how a store compared to other stores, especially in Woo, where it can sometimes feel like we&#8217;re all kind of isolated on our own server and our own websites, not necessarily all on one platform. There was a lot of demand for clarity into what was going on. So people were asking for it a while ago, but a project like this is challenging to do well and at the quality level that I wanted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We couldn&#8217;t do it with the few of us that were working together, but the team&#8217;s growing recently and we&#8217;ve got more resources. Luke, someone who just joined primarily for marketing and design-related stuff, said, &#8220;Oh, I reckon I could throw something together if you can get the data.&#8221; We were just sitting around the couch here in Melbourne, brainstorming ideas. It&#8217;d be cool to see that stat and then on Twitter, I think Katie, we talked about some stats even a couple of months ago, about bundles. I was also talking with Vova from Freemius about different subscription stats. We started to create this foundation to do this at scale, thinking about privacy at the forefront of that. So anonymized samples of all that data and just using averages to try to paint a picture of what was going on. Once we had that list to work from, it started to be pretty fun. We were just going through a list like, okay, let&#8217;s try and figure out that metric and that one, and then you&#8217;ve got to actually dig through it a lot more to find the interesting parts. But it was a big project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I think it&#8217;s really useful for companies like yourself that have access to data of multiple sites to publish that because, as you said a minute ago, WooCommerce sites are all installed on people&#8217;s own servers unless you&#8217;re using Woo Express or something and people just don&#8217;t have those benchmarks. I&#8217;ve seen a bit of that going on in the industry. For example, WP Fusion&#8217;s year in review reports are really useful from a WordPress perspective because they publish data about the different sites running WP Fusion, which LMS plugins are the most popular and page builders and so on. So it was really nice to see a WooCommerce version of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />I think the fun thing for me was this was, I mean, I love Woo. It&#8217;s where I first started working, my first job really was at Woo, and then it&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve really ever known. I love it as a platform. I love what it enables, the fact that people can run their own site, control everything, customize everything, but also own everything. That idea of data ownership is so important to me. Woo enables that. Part of doing the report was wanting to validate, even though all these sites are their little islands out there on the internet, the scale that Woo is operating at is massive. I don&#8217;t think people realize it. We hear numbers being thrown around, several million Woo stores and things like that, but they don&#8217;t really mean anything until you actually see the data behind it and the scale and that validation, the brands that are using it. I don&#8217;t think people know how many Woo stores out there are doing millions of dollars a year in revenue. There&#8217;s tens of thousands, but yeah, I&#8217;m not sure the exact number, but there are so many stores out there that are really pushing the limits of Woo and people don&#8217;t know about it. So it&#8217;s cool to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />You said that Luke came in and kind of threw something together, but this is actually really polished and really nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Luke is so talented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Before we get into some of the different pieces of it, I do want to let people know that they can also follow along with us at metorik.com/woocommerce-insights. We&#8217;ll leave that link in the show notes, but if people want to look at it while we&#8217;re having a discussion here, that&#8217;s metorik.com/woocommerce-insights. I ended up writing just a ton of questions basically on every slide, so I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll get to all of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />That&#8217;s awesome. No, whatever is interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />I kind of want to jump in, maybe start from the top and work our way down. One of the first things that you shared in here is that the average age of WooCommerce stores is four years. That kind of lines up with the start of COVID in my head. How do you think COVID changed the landscape of ecommerce or specifically, WooCommerce?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />What we saw when COVID happened? Yeah, it&#8217;s an interesting perspective when you are coming at it as a SaaS because maybe as a plugin maker, Katie, you would&#8217;ve seen at the time an increase in sales as more people were setting up Woo stores. But for us, it wasn&#8217;t just an influx of more stores, but what was really interesting was what every store was doing across the line, the scale of the growth during that time. We have some reports we were looking at back then just in terms of being able to run the app and see the scale of order volume and Airbnb and things like that across everyone. It&#8217;s like a spike around COVID and just consistently through that whole period, we found that on average every store was doing better. There were definitely a lot of new stores starting, but I found it more interesting to see the existing stores all grow as a result of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, that all dropped off, and you can actually, it&#8217;s pretty interesting when you look at the higher scale, a five-year period, you see that growth and that decline happen through the actual order volume that&#8217;s happening. But in terms of the age, a lot of it comes down to the fact that Woo itself is not that old. The oldest a store could possibly be is probably 10 years, I&#8217;m not sure the exact age. Over time, very few stores are going to go from 11 years and still be running after all that time or necessarily be on the same platform. I think four years is actually probably bigger than what I&#8217;d expect just because Woo is such a young platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />That makes sense. A slightly more practical question, I was interested to see that you said 32% of stores are tracking their costs and profit as well as their sales. I was interested because I didn&#8217;t know it was possible to do via a website analytics tool. Everybody knows you&#8217;d use it to get sales data and things like that, which is a lot better than the sales data you get from WooCommerce reports in core, which is very basic obviously. But how does that work, tracking costs and profit, because that data isn&#8217;t entered into the WooCommerce admin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />I think that&#8217;s actually something that I&#8217;d love to see WooCommerce core improve, having the ability to set up a product cost. It should just be built into Woo by default. Shopify has it by default, almost Square does, almost every other ecommerce or commerce platform does because it is something that if you look at like 80/20, 80% plus of stores probably do have a cost that they want to set on a product. It should be core. It&#8217;s not, but we decided to offer that as a feature. Before that though, we just integrated directly with the WooCommerce Cost of Goods plugin, which itself Skyverge made, and that&#8217;s probably explained why it was so good and it worked really well because for us, we were able to then basically build this whole profit</p>\n\n\n\n<p>reporting feature and have all historical costs come in and profit reports come in without stores having to do anything. It was really cool because they&#8217;d never even had that. They&#8217;d set up a product cost inside of WooCommerce Cost of Goods, and there were some basic reports, but all of a sudden we were able just to bring that data in and kind of cleared it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It got to a point where we were just telling everyone to go and buy the Cost of Goods plugin. People were like, well, I don&#8217;t want to install a new plugin just to have a field on my product page to set the cost. That&#8217;s very fair, especially when they don&#8217;t need the reports and the other functionality from it. So we decided to build it into the app. Of course, it morphed into something much bigger. We got shipping transaction, extra cost. You can say a lot of people want us to do their monthly salary costs and office expenses. They really want to have a bigger picture of things. We&#8217;re not really meant to be an accounting or profit tool in that way, but over time it&#8217;s kind of becoming that. People want more and more from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the other cool things you can do as a SaaS when it comes to this kind of thing is we integrate with Google Ads, TikTok ads, Facebook ads, all these different providers to let people bring in their live advertising costs from those platforms. It starts to be a really cool experience as a user because you&#8217;re getting all this data from different places in one location and getting to actually report on it, aggregate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />What&#8217;s keeping the other 70-odd percent or so from doing the same? Is it a knowledge thing about whether they don&#8217;t know that that exists or is it an industry thing where it doesn&#8217;t make sense for some folks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />I think industry plays a big part. Privacy is another issue. We don&#8217;t have it in a way, again, it was just kind of bolted onto the app. It wasn&#8217;t what we initially set out to do. We don&#8217;t have a way for you to just say, this user can see all the reports, but they can&#8217;t see the cost and profit. That&#8217;s a common thing that a store owner might want to hide from their team. They want them in there using metrics for the reports. A lot of users have asked us to do that and we&#8217;ll probably do that soon. I think that would increase adoption a little bit. But also, we&#8217;re not trying to be an app for them to figure out their profit and pay taxes on. We don&#8217;t encourage it in that way. When people come to proper reporting, they&#8217;re probably looking for that level of detail. They need to incorporate all their costs across the whole thing, salary to everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interesting part on our end starts to be trying to figure out reports based on that. We added these reports to the app a few months ago for doing cohorts, customer cohorts based on when they join by the month they join, week they join, or maybe the first product or first coupon they use. It&#8217;s really cool to split your customers up into those cohorts automatically and then see the lifetime profit and profit margin over time, how that changes. Then you start to understand not just at what point a customer has spent enough that they&#8217;ve reached a target revenue per customer, but they&#8217;ve actually become profitable. You can measure that and be like, by month 14, we know on average that&#8217;s where we&#8217;ve got enough profit from each customer. I love that part of it more than being an accounting tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />It&#8217;s really helping WooCommerce store owners to run their company as a proper business. A lot are more hobbyist sites and it helps to bring them to the next level. Some of them will already be doing that, of course, but a lot of WooCommerce store owners don&#8217;t do that kind of thing. This is really making it much more accessible. I&#8217;m kind of wishing I use WooCommerce on my own website. I use Easy Digital Downloads and I can&#8217;t access any of this because quite sensibly you&#8217;ve built this for WooCommerce and Shopify, the two biggest players. I get that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />I have had some requests for EDD, but every single request has come from people I knew in the community who would want it. Then I start to think about how many stores that is and it&#8217;s maybe a couple of hundred that I know would pay for it as well. It starts to be a little harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, totally agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />But I&#8217;ve always wanted to build it for EDD because all my friends and all my colleagues are using EDD rather than Woo. At the start, it wasn&#8217;t like I could really contact too many of my friends running WordPress businesses and say, please use my product because they were using EDD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />You mentioned earlier about maybe they should put something in core related to the cost of goods. I was thinking that when I saw your stat about subscriptions, 28% of all the WooCommerce stores that you track use subscriptions. The vast majority of them will be WooCommerce subscriptions to one specific plugin, of course. I know they will never put that in core because they must make so much money from that premium only add-on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />I don&#8217;t think they make enough from it to be honest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Because it&#8217;s so valuable in recurring revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Exactly. It&#8217;s one thing that we&#8217;d probably do next year and we want to improve in a report based on the feedback, but also just based on what I think would be interesting is actually saying, while maybe it&#8217;s 27% of stores that have subscriptions on, does that actually account for more like 40-50% of the revenue or are those stores by default on average double or triple stores that don&#8217;t have subscriptions? We didn&#8217;t go into that and I think we&#8217;d like to expand on that, but I think that would actually show that while maybe 27-30% are using subscriptions, those stores tend to be much more successful because it&#8217;s such a great business model if you can make it work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, absolutely. I want to shift gears a tiny little bit and talk about, you have a couple of slides in here about the top themes and plugins in WooCommerce stores. Looking at the top themes and plugins, I see Elementor ranking pretty high in both and Classic Editor at number five in the top plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Not too surprised to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, native WordPress right now with full site editing isn&#8217;t quite ready to handle the majority of WooCommerce stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Well, I think that indicates that there&#8217;s still a heavy dependence on the Classic Editor for sure. A lot of that might come through other builders that are being used, but also maybe other WooCommerce plugins and stuff that aren&#8217;t quite there yet. I know even for us, we&#8217;ve been integrating with commerce blocks and stuff for the checkout recently for an update we&#8217;ve been working on. I think a lot of the filters that we needed were only added in a WooCommerce version that just came out or is about to come out. That&#8217;s certainly fine if things take time and it&#8217;s good to take time to get it right, but if we&#8217;re an app that&#8217;s trying to really stay ahead and move with Woo, we were really only able to integrate with some of those features in a version that&#8217;s just coming out now on June 24. It&#8217;s going to take time for that shift to happen, maybe longer than anyone&#8217;s expecting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus, while you mentioned that, it makes me think about a part of the report that I found a little surprising and actually came out of a discussion I had recently about PHP versions. I noticed that 7.4 is still at 45% of WooCommerce stores that we&#8217;re tracking. I think that&#8217;s actually higher than the average across all of WordPress generally. There is that kind of fear when it comes to an ecommerce store. Upgrades come at a very big cost if it messes up. If your site goes down or if something&#8217;s incompatible and you have downtime, it&#8217;s not just downtime, it&#8217;s losing money time. That&#8217;s a very valid concern for an ecommerce store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, one of the other stats that just screamed off the page at me was that the average number of active plugins is 58 on a WooCommerce store. So compatibility-wise, you have to make sure that all 58 of those are ready to move beyond PHP 7.4 before you upgrade. But also, why so many and what do the annual costs look like? Not all of those plugins are going to be free. I know a lot of WooCommerce plugins cost an annual fee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Yeah. I think we are always, and I think that comes with a caveat with this report, we&#8217;re looking at stores that are willing to pay us, Metorik, as an app, at least $20 a month, and in most cases, $100 plus a month for an app for their WooCommerce store. They aren&#8217;t reflective of every WooCommerce store. I think with that means they&#8217;re willing to spend for sure at least two, $3,000 a year on their website if they&#8217;re willing to pay that much to us as an app for their website. It&#8217;s reasonable to think that most of them would have 10, 20 plus active subscriptions, but with that cost comes so much value because a lot of these stores are doing significant numbers and significant volume. If they wanted to have a similar setup, an equivalent setup on another platform like Shopify, they would be looking at a larger annual cost for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I enjoyed the section about order milestones. I spent quite a while looking at that and trying to visualize the typical store and how long it takes them to get any significant momentum and so on. It is interesting to see that the majority, 76%, get to a thousand orders and it takes just over a year, whereas it&#8217;s a pretty small number that make a hundred thousand orders ever, which is 7.9%, and that takes multiple years. A million orders, which kind of makes sense, is only 1%. It&#8217;s interesting to see the</p>\n\n\n\n<p>dropoff. It made me wonder how WooCommerce compared with that regard to other platforms that might be more enterprise-tailored or something, whereas lots of WooCommerce stores are more small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Yeah, that&#8217;s a good point. Look, Shopify for sure, I think the number would be a bit quicker, but I don&#8217;t know necessarily how many are getting to that scale as well. I think it would be similar, but again, I do think it always comes back to if the store is investing a lot more in their online presence through paying more for the ecommerce platform, through spending more on hosting or developers or marketing costs, any of those things, they&#8217;re typically going to be a bigger store. I think WooCommerce by default is a cheaper option, so you do tend to get stores that invest less in marketing at the start. But then that&#8217;s what we saw that I found really interesting with this report. You kind of get to that a hundred K, and we didn&#8217;t have enough time to really show a good picture between that a hundred and a million, but you scale so much faster at that point because you&#8217;ve already got the momentum, you&#8217;ve already got the infrastructure set up, and probably more than anything, you&#8217;re at a point in the business where you want to invest in marketing and other ways to improve your store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />It kind of fits with a theory I&#8217;ve been developing about the way that WordPress and WooCommerce are growing more widely. If you look at data on Built With, which I was looking at yesterday, I think I tweeted about it actually, if you look at WordPress and WooCommerce&#8217;s growth for the top hundred thousand sites, the top million sites, they&#8217;re actually going down a bit. They&#8217;re declining, but then if you tick the whole internet box on Built With, they&#8217;re going up quite rapidly. So that says to me that the growth is in the smaller websites, and I thought that might fit with your data that the majority have a smaller number of orders as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Yeah. I think the tricky thing with all of those numbers that are out there with Built With in different companies that try to track the state of ecommerce across the whole internet is that we just don&#8217;t know how many of those sites are actually operating and have at least 20 sales a year. You&#8217;ve got to learn a hundred, and I think really the number of stores that is like sub a hundred orders a year is the majority probably. And that&#8217;s okay. There&#8217;s still so many stores out there that are doing larger numbers, but especially with sites that are just being set up and not running, you can do that basically for free on WooCommerce. We always have to take those numbers with a grain of salt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, I was looking at that chart as well. Less than 10% of stores make it to that a hundred thousand plus orders mark within an average time of four years or so to make it to this milestone. Why do you think stores don&#8217;t stick it out? The average time to a million plus is like six years. Is it just a patience issue? Do people just need to be in it for the long run? Do people give up too early?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Maybe. Maybe they&#8217;ve switched platforms as well. It&#8217;s hard to really paint that picture in a report like this, but it&#8217;s something that we see tends to happen. Stores get to a certain size and they end up then wanting to try a different platform, become Shopify or something custom. I&#8217;ve seen stores go to Magento, and so I think that sometimes can be a reason. But also it&#8217;s just really hard to get to that scale. You see people on Shopify, especially because they send out these trophies and things like that to commemorate when you get to certain milestones, they send a physical item. I think you order it through them to merchants and you see people posting on Twitter, but the reality is there aren&#8217;t that many stores that are getting a million plus orders. That&#8217;s a big volume. If you&#8217;re doing a hundred plus average AOV, that&#8217;s like a hundred million. So a more realistic average Woo store, I don&#8217;t think we published it in it. The number I was seeing was something like off the top of my head, 30, 40,000 orders, something around that bracket. But that&#8217;s still massive, especially if an average order is a hundred dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />The ones that are switching platforms, what is making them want to do that? What is WooCommerce not doing well at a hundred thousand or a million orders?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />That&#8217;s probably an episode in itself just because it&#8217;s such a big thing to unpack. At that scale, stores are thinking about what matters to them. What I&#8217;ve found, it&#8217;s not even about reliability, but having someone to depend on. I think Shopify does that well. It&#8217;s like a safety net. A merchant running on that, even if their site does go down, it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s going down with every other Shopify site and that gives them some confidence. Shopify&#8217;s reliability recently has been really good. So a lot of it is peace of mind. Merchants don&#8217;t want to be technical. They don&#8217;t want to get in the weeds that much. They really just want to run their shop and not think about plugin updates or anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I see a lot of WooCommerce agencies now pop up that are focusing on maintenance plans and things like that, that&#8217;s really good and a step in the right direction. But it needs to come as well with the reliability or the escape, the reassurance that someone&#8217;s got your back if the site goes down and you&#8217;re not going to lose your order data and things like that. The cost to a store if their site goes down and they have to restore to a backup and it&#8217;s eight hours before, and in that time they had orders, it&#8217;s such a big cost that it would almost pay for a subscription for Shopify or something else in a year. If it&#8217;s going to solve it by going to one of those platforms, they&#8217;re going to do it. There needs to be enough upside for them to stay with Woo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a lot of stores, subscriptions are amazing and above, beyond what most subscription platforms that exist for Shopify allow. The cost of running on Woo is low. If you can do that at scale and you can really optimize your site and handle how you tackle downtime, but also have a good backup plan, have a good recovery plan, then you start to save several hundred thousand a year with Woo if you&#8217;re a big store and maybe even a million plus if you&#8217;re doing tens of millions a year in revenue. Woo has a lot of advantages. It&#8217;s just about finding the disadvantages and trying to solve them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Marcus, did you have any questions about the average order stuff or the refunds?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />I had one. You have a note on the refund section that physical goods are refunded at lower amounts than software because of the low overhead for software. In general, the outlier here seems to be clothing and footwear. I think I have an idea, but what makes that industry have the highest refund rate?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />It&#8217;s probably one of the most compelling things you can offer as a business in that industry is free returns and really to almost encourage them and say, order from us as much as you want, and then the few things you don&#8217;t want to send it back will include a free return bag because that&#8217;s really how those stores start to get higher AOV. I think it&#8217;s a symptom of that, but it&#8217;s probably by design and it probably does actually increase the AOV for that industry quite a lot more than what it would be without it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I see that online learning has an 85% refund rate, which is kind of scary because it makes me think that people are abusing it potentially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Oh no, that&#8217;s only 85% of the refund amount, not refund rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Oh, okay. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />I&#8217;d be surprised if they were doing well enough to keep running their shop with that much of a refund rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Oh, the amounts 1.5%. Yeah, that&#8217;s better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Exactly. The one that we want to highlight with the refund amount was just to show, when a refund does happen, is it a full refund? Is it a partial one? I found that interesting with some consumable ones like food and beverage, the refund amount on average is 56%. That would indicate that a lot of stores are doing partial refunds. Maybe one of the items they&#8217;re not happy with is not worth the cost of returning it, while software or online learning, it&#8217;s 80-85% because it&#8217;s a digital item. You can effectively refund the whole thing without incurring a major cost as a store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Those are a little harder to partially refund too. Refund a handful of lessons from a course. You&#8217;re either refunding the course or you&#8217;re not refunding the course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Exactly. You might as well, if you&#8217;re having a credit cost as a software business, just find a solution like that. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve experienced the thing, both of you, over the years with WooCommerce and WordPress support. Sometimes just to solve it, let them move on, give them a refund rather than try to hold on to 70 or 80% of the money or even 20-30% of the money. Risk covering someone who really has it out for you after that and wouldn&#8217;t speak favorably about you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I thought the devices section was interesting. We&#8217;ll all have heard many stats way before this report that the majority of online shoppers are using mobile devices. I&#8217;ve always kind of ignored that on my own website because we sell WordPress plugins. The vast majority are sitting at their desks on their desktops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />What percent is, in your case?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I can&#8217;t remember off the top of my head, but it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know, 70 or 80% or something on desktop, which makes sense. You don&#8217;t buy a plugin on your phone, do you? You&#8217;re at work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />I hadn&#8217;t realized that we had this in the report, I forgot,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>but it says it there. Software stores have the most desktop-driven customers with 79% of orders being placed on a desktop device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Which makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />That checks out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />For other industries, obviously mobile&#8217;s important for my business as well, but it&#8217;s more so for things like clothes where people are buying from their sofas and so on. It was interesting seeing that the average order value placed on desktop is significantly higher than people ordering on their mobiles. Even if you are in a mobile-first industry, you do really need to think about those desktop users because even if they&#8217;re buying clothes or something that suggests to me that they&#8217;re having a serious session of buying clothes, they&#8217;re sitting at their computer, got multiple tabs open, it&#8217;s a very different experience and they spend more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />That&#8217;s a good point. Another common one is if you&#8217;re buying an appliance or an electronic product, a lot of those decisions are made at the computer where you can really take the time to research, look at five different tabs and then check out. That&#8217;s a kind of trend with a lot of these numbers. A lot of them aren&#8217;t as surprising, but the actual level that the number ended up at, in this case, 38 to 62, I didn&#8217;t know that until we pulled that. Actually, to be fair, I didn&#8217;t realize that the desktop AOV would be that much higher. If you just asked me off the top of my head, I would&#8217;ve guessed anecdotally 30-40%, not almost double. I think it just comes down to when you&#8217;re doing a high-value order, when you are spending several hundred dollars in a shop, you&#8217;re going to probably do it on a computer. Typically they&#8217;re going to move to a desktop for those transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah. I also was interested for the same reason in that section. It kind of made me think about my purchasing habits and maybe how important it is for stores to have carts that you can move between mobile and desktop via login or something. I spend a lot of time browsing on my mobile device and I&#8217;ll toss things in the cart, but then by the time I&#8217;m ready to make a purchase, I might hop over to the computer. I&#8217;ve got desktop extensions that help with coupon codes and all of that kind of thing that I can take advantage of that I don&#8217;t have on my mobile device. Really a lot of the purchasing, I would guess that I&#8217;m not in the minority, that there&#8217;s a lot of folks that are browsing on their mobile and then making an actual final purchase on their desktop, especially like you said, with high order value items and orders and stuff. Just being able to, Amazon obviously, right? I&#8217;ll toss a bunch of things in an Amazon cart and then, because I&#8217;m logged in, I can log back in on the computer and finish that order. The importance of having a system like that, maybe for even smaller stores to be able to jump between devices and keep your cart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />It&#8217;s an interesting product idea, really. I think we kind of do that, and a lot of plugins do that in a small way through abandoned cart tracking and being able to send a link that just restores it in one click, which is close. But I&#8217;m just thinking about, it&#8217;d be quite cool, even just a simple plugin that was just like, send me a link right now just to access this cart on a computer. That would probably have some value rather than being this whole thing to track carts. It can tie into that, but I think just as a core feature, I want to move this cart to a desktop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Speaking of recovered carts, I also saw in the report that the average order value of recovered carts is about 30% higher than even regular placed orders. The report states it&#8217;s because customers tend to add multiple items into their cart before making a decision. Then they get that abandoned cart link and they come back and place the order. What are some good abandoned cart strategies to recover these carts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Offer an incentive, and I think the incentive should be specific to your store and the situation you&#8217;re in. There&#8217;s no one size fits all. We kind of lead into this in one of the other pages where we talk about later in the report to do with the AOV of free shipping versus paid shipping orders. Something interesting with that is figuring out where your AOV is. In that case, if we&#8217;re looking at the cart report, it&#8217;s around 120, which is where the average cart value was when they got placed. Maybe you&#8217;d be wanting to incentivize people to spend over 150 and get free shipping or over 150 and get 10% off because at least then you&#8217;re increasing your AOV by 40-50% at the cost of a 10-15% discount. I think that&#8217;s one way, but otherwise, it&#8217;s also about using the moment when you try to recover a cart as a marketing opportunity. It&#8217;s not just saying, recover your cart, but maybe you should also add this item based on what you already have in your cart. It ends up being an actual win for the customer because they might discover something that they didn&#8217;t know about, and they&#8217;re getting a better deal with maybe they&#8217;re getting free shipping as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />I didn&#8217;t see in the report numbers on the percentage of stores using abandoned cart recovery versus not using abandoned cart recovery practices. Do you have maybe anecdotal numbers on how many people are actually taking advantage of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />That&#8217;s a good question. Again, in our case, it&#8217;s all limited to the scope of Metorik because someone would have to turn on the cart tracking feature. We have then opted to pay extra for our email feature to send an abandoned cart email, which is why we didn&#8217;t go too deep into that because it&#8217;s just not big enough scale to be too insightful. Of the stores actually adding, anecdotally, it&#8217;s like 20-30% of our stores are trying to recover carts, not enough. It&#8217;s very common that I&#8217;ll meet really successful stores that are doing significant numbers but aren&#8217;t really focusing on abandoned cart recovery, but also failed order recovery and really simple actions like that alone will pay for the cost of Metorik or any other plugin or app to do it. You just need to recover several carts and you can recover the cost of the software to do it. It&#8217;s worth investing in for almost any business. Again, it depends on the industry and the business and the brand and all those factors. It&#8217;s never one size fits all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Katie, is that something that you guys think about for the plugins? I don&#8217;t know how that works with EDD or any of the setup that you guys have. I know that you have demos with InstaWP, and you&#8217;re tracking all that stuff too. Is abandoned cart recovery something that you guys talk about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah. I miss Jilt. I know you used to work for that company. That was the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Jilt was such a great product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Such a shame. We now use Recapture, which is nowhere near as good as Jilt was, but it kind of does the job. The data isn&#8217;t brilliant. It&#8217;s pretty basic, but we do recover a lot of carts that way, which as Bryce said, more than pays for Recapture. We also use it for post-purchase emails, like sending a discount code to people a few days after they make a purchase and stuff like that. We do get our money&#8217;s worth out of Recapture. There isn&#8217;t, for Easy Digital Downloads, a particularly professional abandoned cart solution. I think a lot of mailing list providers like MailChimp and so on integrate with WooCommerce as well as you having your own paid feature, Bryce, as well. Hopefully it&#8217;s better for WooCommerce than EDD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />There&#8217;s definitely more options for Woo. I don&#8217;t think, again, Woo is typically a second-class citizen in a way on every platform. They&#8217;ll tend to just do it as an afterthought, so you don&#8217;t get maybe enough tracked or accuracy when it comes to carts. A lot of our cart tracking was inspired by Jilt. I think the whole team did such a good job on that product. We took a lot of inspiration from that. Klaviyo and all those apps that do integrate with Woo, MailChimp, they&#8217;re going to be thinking about Woo once every few months. It&#8217;s not like an active daily thought in how they develop and improve the product. It&#8217;s really fun for me to try to prioritize Woo and think, how can I make the best possible product for these merchants that typically aren&#8217;t getting anything made for them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />On the country and currency section, I thought it was strange that there&#8217;s a significantly higher average order value when the customer is not in the store&#8217;s default currency. So if it&#8217;s a store in the US and they offer in British pounds, then there&#8217;d be a higher average order value on average than the US dollars. I can&#8217;t think of any reason why. Can you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Yeah, no, definitely. I think it actually leads into two pages forward where we talk about, or several pages forward where we talk about delivery distances and how people typically spend more when they&#8217;re ordering from further away. A lot of it comes down to when you are ordering from a store in a remote area, it&#8217;s a bigger deal. You might have to pay more for shipping. It might be something you can do less frequently because of the cost. The average order tends to be higher because of that reason, where they&#8217;re trying to maximize that moment where they are making a purchase. It does lead into that idea where stores that offer free shipping end up having a higher AOV, and that can encourage higher spending. If you&#8217;re in an international country paying in a different currency, that free shipping could make a difference and make you spend a lot more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I do that all the time. Being in Australia, most of the things I&#8217;m buying online are from overseas, and I will always spend even double or triple to get free shipping, which isn&#8217;t logical in that way, but no one likes</p>\n\n\n\n<p>paying for shipping. I don&#8217;t want to pay 20 pounds to ship something from the UK. I would much rather just pay 300 pounds and get free shipping, but I get 300 pounds worth of items. It&#8217;s a weird thing, but I think a lot of people I spoke to about this report, especially Australian people, but really anyone American ordering from Europe or Europe ordering from America or Asia from anywhere in the world, you want to maximize those purchases to get free shipping, but also it might just not be something you do frequently because you have to wait several weeks for the delivery to come. So you want to spend a bit more instead of something local where you can order several times in a week and it&#8217;s not going to be that much of a delay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />I&#8217;m an Amazon Prime member, like many folks, at least in the US, probably all over the world, so I&#8217;m used to the free shipping. I was going to say, it&#8217;s no surprise that free shipping increases the average order value, but also I&#8217;m wondering if we&#8217;ve all been kind of conditioned to expect free shipping as an option. It shows in the report that about two-thirds of stores are offering it. What advice would you have for the third of stores that are not yet offering free shipping? Is it just a barrier for them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />I don&#8217;t remember if we actually had the number of stores that offer free shipping, but I know that 66% of orders did have free shipping, which as a sheer number of orders is significant. But I&#8217;m curious, for stores that don&#8217;t offer free shipping, is that just a no-brainer that you should offer free shipping? That&#8217;ll basically guarantee a higher average order value?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not necessarily on every order, especially if your shipping costs are high. It&#8217;s feasible, but you need to figure out what is your shipping cost. Not just what you&#8217;re charging customers, because a lot of stores tend to charge a bit more. What&#8217;s your actual cost? What would your cost be if you were able to have double the number of orders because you&#8217;re offering free shipping? The cost might come down with that volume. But I would say figure out your cost and then factor that in. If I know my average cost is $9 and my average order is $50, if I could make free shipping over 90 or 80, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m getting 30, $40 more revenue at a cost of nine or $10. It typically comes down to that, figuring out where you&#8217;re at, but where you want to get to. Free shipping is just a lever to get there. Abandoned cart discounts are another way, multiple different paths, and it depends on the store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />That fits quite nicely into the page about delivery distances and where you talk about how far away people are ordering. It looks like the majority of stores are doing proper shipping, and they&#8217;re not just delivering pizza places delivering within a few miles. There&#8217;s a lot of people delivering, even thousands of kilometers, aren&#8217;t there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Yeah, I think I&#8217;m just looking at that report as well. Sure, under a thousand kilometers looks like it&#8217;s around 50% of orders. But that&#8217;s a significant number of orders that are going a further distance, which is great. That&#8217;s what ecommerce is about. It&#8217;s about enabling people to buy the items that they normally couldn&#8217;t get locally. Being in a pretty remote place like Australia, you really appreciate it. So much stuff I love that I have to get from overseas. In my case, every order is traveling 10,000k or more. That probably brings it up a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />You alone are making up that 3% of orders that travel more than 10,000 kilometers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />In some industries, maybe. I did buy a lot of stuff from the UK recently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I never knew that about Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Of course, we have so many amazing Australian brands and products and companies to buy from, but if you&#8217;re into a niche thing, I really love synthesizers. A lot of that&#8217;s not coming from Australia or records as well. They&#8217;re coming from America, Japan, places like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I have a similar issue in Spain. Nearly everything is not available from Spain and I need to order it from elsewhere. So then there is that, depending on where you live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />It goes back to that if you are ordering from somewhere domestically in Spain, you don&#8217;t need to really maximize that order as much as you are ordering from the states and have to incur shipping. You&#8217;d probably want to add a couple more items because you&#8217;re not going to make that order from the US every week, but you might do that domestically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Well, thank you so much, Bryce. That&#8217;s been really interesting, and I think it&#8217;s given us some good perspectives on WooCommerce that we never had access to before. So that&#8217;s really helpful. Thank you so much. Before we finish, can you tell us where we can find you online and also where we can read the report in full?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Yeah, of course. For me, I&#8217;m on Twitter at BryceAdams. I don&#8217;t tweet much, but I&#8217;m trying to be better and taking a lot of inspiration from you, Katie, to try to engage more. The report is on Metorik at <a href=\"https://metorik.com/woocommerce-insights\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://metorik.com/woocommerce-insights</a>. I hope people love it and really let us know your feedback because if there are metrics that people want or would find useful for their business, we want to include those next year. A lot of this was just done on what we thought people would want, but we really do want to build it for not just our customers, but the WooCommerce community. It&#8217;d be great to hear more about what numbers would be of value to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Excellent. Well, thank you so much.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong>Woo BizChat</strong>, hosts <strong>Marcus Burnette</strong> and <strong>Katie Keith</strong> chat with <strong>Bryce Adams, founder of Metorik</strong>, to discuss his recently published first <em><strong>Metorik Insights Report for WooCommerce</strong></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deep dive conversation spans a variety of topics, including the average age of WooCommerce stores, the impact of COVID-19 on ecommerce, and the significance of tracking costs and profits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce shares valuable insights on the challenges and opportunities faced by WooCommerce store owners, shedding light on the trends and patterns observed across thousands of stores using Metorik&#8217;s analytics and email automation tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-gray-background-color has-background\"><strong><a href=\"https://metorik.com/woocommerce-insights\">Download the Metorik Insights for WooCommerce</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Highlights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bryce discusses the impact of COVID-19 on ecommerce</strong>, noting significant growth in existing stores during the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The need for better integration of cost and profit tracking features</strong> in WooCommerce core is highlighted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Prevalence of Elementor and Classic Editor</strong> among top themes and plugins in WooCommerce stores is discussed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Continued reliance on PHP 7.4</strong> in many WooCommerce stores is noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Successful WooCommerce stores</strong> often have numerous active plugins and subscriptions, leading to higher costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Order milestones are explored</strong>, revealing why only a small percentage of stores reach a million orders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Strategies for abandoned cart recovery</strong> are covered, including offering incentives and using recovery attempts as marketing opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recovered carts typically have higher average order values</strong>, emphasizing the importance of effective recovery strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The role of free shipping </strong>in boosting average order values is examined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The impact of delivery distances</strong> on ecommerce purchasing behavior is discussed, with insights into how customers maximize their purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://metorik.com/\">Metorik.com</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://metorik.com/woocommerce-insights\">Download the Metorik Insights for WooCommerce</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://x.com/bryceadams\">Bryce Adams on X</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 01 Jul 2024 08:07:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"HeroPress: Voices Of WordCamp Europe: Josephine (Rahissa) Ngo Nonog and Herman Ngembu\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=7182\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:209:\"https://heropress.com/voices-of-wordcamp-europe-josephine-rahissa-ngo-nonog-and-herman-ngembu/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=voices-of-wordcamp-europe-josephine-rahissa-ngo-nonog-and-herman-ngembu\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:836:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"590\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jo_herman-1024x590.webp\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" /><p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big goal of mine was to meet people for the first time.

This launch coincides with the first day of WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2018, Do the Woo has evolved through continuously, growing both in content and community engagement. The decision to move Do the Woo to its own site in late 2022 was the first major step for the future. As we entered 2023, our mission began to extend beyond WooCommerce to encompass the broader WordPress ecosystem. The idea was simple: elevate voices and create a podcast by the community, for the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of 2023, planning for the new started and in October, we solidified our efforts, with the goal of showcasing the diverse range of the Do the Woo podcast channel with our shows. With significant support from WordPress.com, this vision became a reality, culminating in a redesigned site that went live in March.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, we start our prelaunch.

Write articles for frequently asked questions to reduce support requests and provide instant answers to users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-customer-driven-development\">Customer-Driven Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus on customer feedback to guide the development of new features. Use a feature request page where users can submit and vote on new ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-support-automation\">Support Automation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Automate support as much as possible. Use tools to recommend knowledge base articles based on user queries and streamline the support process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-efficient-time-management\">Efficient Time Management</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prioritize tasks by balancing between reactive updates (e.g., API changes) and proactive development of new features based on customer demand and potential business impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-collaborate-with-third-parties\">Collaborate with Third Parties</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Work with third-party developers and services to extend the functionality of your plugin. This helps in managing integrations and keeping your plugin up-to-date.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-profitability-focus\">Profitability Focus</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintain a high level of profitability by being cautious about hiring. Consider hiring only when the workload becomes unmanageable and impacts personal life significantly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-multi-function-roles\">Multi-Function Roles</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When hiring, look for individuals who can handle multiple roles, including support, development, and representation at events, to maximize efficiency and reduce costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-self-service-tools\">Self-Service Tools</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Develop tools that allow users to solve their problems without contacting support.

Adam is a PR specialist that is founder of <strong><a href=\"https://cirrusinfluence.com/\">Cirrus Influence</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Start with the why:</strong> Before starting a PR campaign or diving into networking events like WordCamps, clarify the purpose and objectives behind your efforts. Understanding the &#8220;why&#8221; will guide your actions and decisions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Identify your tribe:</strong> Find the communities or groups where your target audience is active and engage with them. Building relationships within these communities can provide invaluable support and opportunities for collaboration.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Be bold and persistent:</strong> Don&#8217;t be afraid to reach out to potential partners or event organizers. Even if you receive a &#8220;no&#8221; initially, don&#8217;t be discouraged. Seek constructive feedback and consider alternative approaches for future endeavors.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Develop your expertise:</strong> Continuously work on improving and sharing your knowledge and expertise. Consider giving talks at local meetups or WordCamps to establish yourself as an industry expert.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Practice public speaking:</strong> Engage in activities like Toastmasters to improve your public speaking skills. Confidence in presenting your ideas is crucial for effective communication and networking.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Embrace confidence:</strong> Confidence doesn&#8217;t come from external validation. You have to believe in yourself and your capabilities. Take the initiative and recognize your own potential.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoid hard-selling tactics:</strong> When participating in events or engaging with potential customers, focus on building relationships rather than pushing sales. Provide value and focus on becoming a trusted resource for your audience.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep track of data and feedback:</strong> Gather data and feedback from your PR activities to assess what is working and what needs improvement. Data points, whether positive or negative, provide insights for refining your PR strategies.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Engage in the margin:</strong> Allocate resources and opportunities for creative marketing initiatives. Having some margin allows you to experiment with brand-building activities and sustain long-term growth.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Utilize WordCamps as relationship building:</strong> Attend and sponsor WordCamps with the intention of building relationships rather than solely emphasizing direct sales. Use these events to connect with the WordPress community and establish your brand identity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t wait for confidence:</strong> Confidence is an internal decision. Don&#8217;t wait for external validation or a sudden surge of belief in your abilities.

Alex Standiford is asking everyone to rethink affiliate programs. Here are 10 ideas that may spark something new in your affiliate program.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Consider Diverse Performance-Based Programs</strong>: Look beyond traditional affiliate models and consider partnerships that offer payouts based on specific performance metrics, such as driving traffic, customer satisfaction, or content engagement, in addition to sales.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Focus on Quality Over Quantity</strong>: Rather than targeting a large number of affiliates, aim to work closely with a smaller group of committed affiliates who are aligned with your brand and have the potential for significant conversions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Develop Personalized Partnerships</strong>: Foster stronger relationships with affiliates by providing personalized support, workflow insights, and one-on-one consultations to maximize their success.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Explore Profit Margin-based Payouts</strong>: Determine payout percentages based on your profit margins, ensuring that the compensation aligns with the value brought in by affiliates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Emphasize Collaboration Among Affiliates</strong>: Allow for multiple affiliates to earn credit for the same sale, encouraging collaboration and teamwork among the affiliates rather than fostering competition.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Evaluate the Long-term Commitment of Affiliates</strong>: Understand the level of commitment required for your products or services, especially for items with significant user loyalty, such as recurring payment services, and consider tailored affiliate approaches for each category.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoid Over-reliance on Volume-based Traffic</strong>: Challenge the effectiveness of purely volume-based traffic and explore more nuanced and sustainable strategies to create a more targeted and engaged audience.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Encourage Allyship and Teamwork Among Affiliates</strong>: Foster an environment where affiliates can work together as allies, leveraging each other&#8217;s strengths to attract and convert traffic, encouraging specialized roles and collaboration for improved performance.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consider Tailored Affiliate Programs</strong>: Explore the possibility of customizing affiliate programs to match specific niches, addressing the limitations of generic affiliate approaches and contributing to improved partnership outcomes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Prioritize In-depth Support and Education</strong>: Provide comprehensive resources, insights, and dedicated support to affiliates, setting up workflows to guide them through effective strategies and enable overall success.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You can learn about Alex&#8217;s WordPress plugin <strong><a href=\"https://www.sirenaffiliates.com/\">SirenAffilates.com</a></strong> and / or listen to the full episode on Do the Woo: <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/reimagining-affiliate-programs-for-your-woo-biz-with-alex-standiford/\"><strong>Reimagining Affiliate Programs for Your Woo Biz with Alex Standiford</strong></a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:48:\"WpOrg\\Requests\\Utility\\CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 05:26:53 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 05:15:43 GMT\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";s:7:\"alt-svc\";s:19:\"h3=\":443\"; ma=86400\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211220140300\";}', 'no');
